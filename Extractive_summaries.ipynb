'Learning representations.', 'Arguably, the problem of learning representations from data in an unsupervised manner is one of the long-standing problems in machine learning BID2 BID25 .', 'One of the earliest algorithms used to achieve is goal is Principal Component Analysis, or PCA BID33 BID19 .', 'For instance, PCA has been used to learn low-dimensional representations of human faces BID41 , or to produce a hierarchy of features BID8 .', 'The nonlinear extension of PCA is an autoencoder BID1 , which is in turn one of the most extended algorithms to learn low-dimensional representations from data.', 'Similar algorithms learn low-dimensional representations of data with certain structure.', 'For instance, in sparse coding BID0 BID30 , the representation of one image is the linear combination of a very few elements from a dictionary of features.', 'More recently, BID46 realized the capability of deep neural networks to map large collections of images to noise vectors, and Bojanowski and Joulin (2017) exploited a similar procedure to learn visual features unsupervisedly.', 'Similarly to us, BID3 allow the noise vectors z to move in order to better learn the mapping from images to noise vectors.', 'The proposed GLO is the analogous to these works, in the opposite direction: learn a map from noise vectors to images.', 'Finally, the idea of mapping between images and noise to learn generative models is a well known technique BID9 BID23 BID39 BID5 .Nuisance Variables One might consider the generator parameters the variables of interest, and Z to be \"nuisance variables\".', 'There is a classical literature on dealing with nuisance parameters while estimating the parameters of interest, including optimization methods as we have used BID40 .', 'In this

We show that by taking the average hidden representation of row a, substracting the one of row b and adding the one of row c, we obtain a coherent image.', 'We show such interpolations with PCA, VAE and GLO.Speech generation Optimizing a latent representation of a generative model has a long history in speech BID35 , both for fitting single examples in the context of fitting a generative model, and in the context of speaker adaptation.', 'The experimental results presented in this work suggest that, in the image domain, we can recover many of the properties of GAN models by using convnets trained with simple reconstruction losses.', 'While this does not invalidate the promise of GANs as generic models of uncertainty or as methods for building generative models, our results suggest that, in order to more fully test the adversarial construction, research needs to move beyond images and convnets.', 'On the other hand, practitioners who care only about generating images for a particular application, and find that the parameterized discriminator does improve their results can use reconstruction losses in their model searches, alleviating some of the instability of GAN training.', 'While the visual quality of the results are promising, especially on the CelebA dataset, they are not yet to the level of the results obtained by GANs on the LSUN bedrooms.', 'This suggest several research directions: one possibility, suggested by 3, is that being able to cover the entire dataset is too onerous a task if all that is required is to generate a few nice samples.', 'In that figure we see that GANs have trouble reconstructing randomly chosen images at the same level of fidelity as their generations.', 'However, GANs can produce good images after a single pass through the data with SGD.', 'In future work we hope to better understand the tension between these two observations.', 'There are many possibilities for improving the quality of GLO samples beyond understanding the effects of coverage.', 'For example other loss functions (e.g. a VGG metric, as in BID32 ), model architectures (here we stayed close to DCGAN for ease of comparison), and more sophisticated sampling methods after training the model all may improve the visual quality of the samples.', 'There is also much work to be done in adding structure to the Z space.', 'Because the methods here keep track of the correspondence between samples and their representatives, and because the Z space is free, we hope to be able to organize the Z in interesting ways as we train.']\n",
            "Are GANs successful because of adversarial training or the use of ConvNets? We show a ConvNet generator trained with a simple reconstruction loss and learnable noise vectors leads many of the desirable properties of a  GAN.\n",
            "The experimental results presented in this work suggest that, in the image domain, we can recover many of the properties of GAN models by using convnets trained with simple reconstruction losses. Therefore, it is reasonable to hypothesize that the reasons for the success of GANs in modeling natural images come from two complementary sources: (A1) Leveraging the powerful inductive bias of deep convnets. (A2) The adversarial training protocol. While this does not invalidate the promise of GANs as generic models of uncertainty or as methods for building generative models, our results suggest that, in order to more fully test the adversarial construction, research needs to move beyond images and convnets. The most common choices of the representation space for GANs are either the uniform distribution on the hypercube DISPLAYFORM1 In previous literature, Gaussian distributions lead to more stable GAN training BID36 , we will take this choice to design our representation space. Since the early layers of convnets focus on edges, the samples from a GAN are sharper. In the case of GLO, we fit a Gaussian distribution with full covariance to the representation space Z, and sample from such distribution to generate new samples. There is a classical literature on dealing with nuisance parameters while estimating the parameters of interest, including optimization methods as we have used BID40 . In the sequel, we initialize the random vectors of GLO using a Gaussian distribution (for the CelebA dataset) or the top d principal components (for the LSUN dataset). In these works, the total loss function optimized to generate is trained separately from the optimization of the latent representation (in the former, the loss is based on a complex wavelet transform, and in the latter, on separately trained autoencoders and classification convolutional networks). On the one hand, a generator plays to transform noise vectors into fake samples, which resemble real samples drawn from a distribution of natural images. On the other hand, practitioners who care only about generating images for a particular application, and find that the parameterized discriminator does improve their results can use reconstruction losses in their model searches, alleviating some of the instability of GAN training. To turn GLO into a generative model, we observe that it suffices to learn a simple probability distribution on the learned noise vectors. Similarly to word embeddings BID31 , linear arithmetic indicates that the generator organizes the noise space to disentangle the nonlinear factors of variation of natural images into linear statistics. On the other hand, a discriminator plays to distinguish between real and fake samples. Our approach, called Generative Latent Optimization (GLO), maps one learnable noise vector to each of the images in our dataset by minimizing a simple reconstruction loss. For example other loss functions (e.g. a VGG metric, as in BID32 ), model architectures (here we stayed close to DCGAN for ease of comparison), and more sophisticated sampling methods after training the model all may improve the visual quality of the samples.\n",
