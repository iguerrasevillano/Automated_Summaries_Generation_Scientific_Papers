              "915    Although AMSGrad has made a positive step towards understanding the theoretical behavior of adaptive gradient methods, the convergence analysis of (Reddi et al., 2018) was still very restrictive because it only works for convex problems, despite the fact that the most successful applications are for non-convex problems. They can be used to either certify the convergence of a given algorithm for a class of problem instances, or to track the progress and behavior of a particular realization of an algorithm.• (Tightness and Insight) We show the conditions are essential and \"tight\", in the sense that violating them can make an algorithm diverge. In a generic first-order optimization algorithm, at a given time t we have access to an unbiased noisy gradient g t of f (x), evaluated at the current iterate x t . The non-convex assumption represents a major departure from the convexity that has been assumed in recent papers for analyzing Adam-type methods, such as (Kingma & Ba, 2014) and (Reddi et al., 2018) .Our work focuses on the generic form of exponentially weighted stochastic gradient descent method presented in Algorithm 1, for which we name as generalized Adam due to its resemblance to the original Adam algorithm and many of its variants. We notice that an independent work (Zhou et al., 2018) has also proved the convergence of AMSGrad with constant β 1 .It is also worth mentioning that Algorithm 1 can be applied to solve the popular \"finite-sum\" problems whose objective is a sum of n individual cost functions. It is easy to show that g t is an unbiased estimator for ∇f (x).In the remainder of this paper, we will analyze Algorithm 1 and provide sufficient conditions under which the algorithm converges to first-order stationary solutions with sublinear rate. The noisy gradient is unbiased and the noise is independent, i.e. DISPLAYFORM0 Reference (Reddi et al., 2018 ) uses a similar (but slightly different) assumption as A2, i.e., the bounded elements of the gradient g t ∞ ≤ a for some finite a. The bounded norm of ∇f (x t ) in A2 is equivalent to Lipschitz continuity of f (when f is differentiable) which is a commonly used condition in convergence analysis. DISPLAYFORM5 Theorem 3.1 implies a sufficient condition that guarantees convergence of the Adam-type methods: s 1 (T ) grows slower than s 2 (T ). We will show in Section 3.2 that the rate s 1 (T ) can be dominated by different terms in different cases, i.e. the non-constant quantities Term A and B below DISPLAYFORM6 where the growth of third term at LHS of (5) can be directly related to growth of Term B via the relationship between 1 and 2 norm or upper boundedness of (α t / √v t ) j . Term A in (5) is a generalization of the term T t=1 a t g t 2 for SGD (where {α t } is the stepsize sequence for SGD), and it quantifies possible increase in the objective function brought by higher order curvature. In our analysis such an oscillation term upper bounds the expected possible ascent in objective induced by skewed update direction g t / √v t (\"skewed\" in the sense that E[g t / √v t ] is not parallel with ∇f (x t )), therefore it cannot be too large. One possible benefit of adaptive gradient methods can be seen from Term A. When this term dominates the convergence speed in Theorem 3.1, it is possible that proper design ofv t can help reduce this quantity compared with SGD (An example is provided in Appendix 6.1.1 to further illustrate this fact.) in certain cases. In contrast, AMSGrad converges in FIG2 because of its smaller oscillation in effective stepsizes, associated with Term B. We finally remark that the importance of the quantity DISPLAYFORM2 DISPLAYFORM3 DISPLAYFORM4 is also noticed by (Huang et al., 2018) . To be specific, the log T factor for AMSGrad would be eliminated when we adopt a constant rather than diminishing stepsize, e.g., α t = 1/ √ T . However, the recent work (Reddi et al., 2018) pointed out the convergence issues of Adam even in the convex setting, and proposed a modified version of Adam (i.e., AMSGrad), which utilizes a non-increasing quadratic normalization and avoids the pitfalls of Adam. One may wonder how diminishing stepsizes affects performance of the algorithms, this is shown in Figure A4 where α t = 0.1/ √ t, we can see SGD is diverging until stepsizes is small, AMSGrad is converging all the time, Adam appears to get stuck but it is actually converging very slowly due to diminishing stepsizes.\n",

              "'In particular, (Santurkar et al., 2018) recently studied the mode collapsing problem and further classified this into the missing mode problem i.e., the generated samples miss some modes in the true data, and the boundary distortion problem i.e., the generated samples can only partly recover some modes in the true data. To handle sequential data in the context of domain adaptation of software vulnerability detection, the work of proposed an architecture referred to as the Code Domain Adaptation Network (CDAN). A fully connected layer is then employed to connect the output layer of the Bidirectional RNN with the joint feature layer while bridging the gap between the source and target domains. In particular, (Santurkar et al., 2018) has recently studied the mode collapsing problem of GANs and discovered that they are also subject to i) the missing mode problem (i.e., in the joint space, either the target data misses some modes in the source data or vice versa) and ii) the boundary distortion problem (i.e., in the joint space either the target data partly covers the source data or vice versa), which makes the target distribution significantly diverge from the source distribution. To address the two inherent problems in the DDAN mentioned in Section 2.4, we employ two different generators G S and G T to map source and target domain examples to the joint space and two discriminators D S and D T to distinguish source examples against target examples and vice versa together with the source classifier C which is used to classify the source examples with labels as shown in Figure 2 . Updating the generators The two generators G S and G T are trained to i) maintain the manifold/cluster structures of source and target data in their original spaces to avoid the data distortion problem and ii) move the target samples toward the source samples in the joint space and resolve the missing mode and boundary distortion problems in the joint space. To move the target samples toward the source samples and resolve the missing mode and boundary distortion problems in the joint space, we propose minimizing the following objective function: Moreover, the source generator G S has to work out the representation that is suitable for the source classifier, hence we need to minimize the following objective function: GD-DDAN) . Therefore, Dual-GD-DDAN allows us to reduce the impact of the missing mode and boundary distortion problems, hence making the target distribution more identical to the source distribution in the joint space. Quantitative Results We first investigate the performance of our proposed Dual-GD-DDAN compared with other methods including VulDeePecker (VULD) without domain adaptation (Li et al., 2016) , DDAN , MMD , D2GAN (Nguyen et al., 2017) and DIRT-T with VAP applied in the joint feature layer using the architecture CDAN introduced in . Inspired by this observation, we compare our Dual-GD-DDAN with DDAN using the representations of the source and target samples in the joint feature space corresponding to their best models. In particular, for a given pair of source and target data sets and for comparing each method, we train a neural network classifier on the best representations of the source data set in the joint space, then predict on the source and target data set and do the same but swap the role of the source and target data sets. We can therefore conclude that our Dual-GD-DDAN method produces a better representation for source and target samples in the joint space and is less susceptible to boundary distortion compared with the DDAN method. These results further demonstrate the ability of our Dual-GD-SDDAN for dealing with the mode collapsing problem better than SCDAN , hence obtaining better predictive performance in the context of software domain adaptation. In this paper, we propose the Dual Generator-Discriminator Deep Code Domain Adaptation Network (Dual-GD-DDAN) method to deal with the missing mode and boundary distortion problems which arise from the use of the GAN principle when reducing the discrepancy between source and target data in the joint space. To deal with this problem, the study introduced in (Li et al., 2018) combined the learning of the vector representations and the training of a classifier in a deep neural network.'"
