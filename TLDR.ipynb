A crucial requirement of such speaker verification systems is to be domain robust. Performance should not degrade even if speakers are talking in languages not seen during training. To this end, we present a flexible and interpretable framework for learning domain invariant speaker embeddings using Generative Adversarial Networks. We combine adversarial training with an angular margin loss function, which encourages the speaker embedding model to be discriminative by directly optimizing for cosine similarity between classes. We are able to beat a strong baseline system using a cosine distance classifier and a simple score-averaging strategy. Our results also show that models with adversarial adaptation perform significantly better than unadapted models. In an attempt to better understand this behavior, we quantitatively measure the degree of invariance induced by our proposed methods using Maximum Mean Discrepancy and Frechet distances. Our analysis shows that our proposed adversarial speaker embedding models significantly reduce the distance between source and target data distributions, while performing similarly on the former and better on the latter. Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). We drawn inspiration from research in computer vision, 48 where GAN based unsupervised domain adaptation methods have been extremely successful BID0 21, 49 18, 19], and adapt these ideas for feature learning in a verification setting. The basic idea is cast 50 domain adaptation/invariance as an adversarial game -generate features or embeddings such that a 51 discriminator cannot tell if they come from the source or target domain. Unlike traditional GANs that 52 work in high-dimensional spaces (e.g. natural images,speech), domain adaptation GANs operate in 53 low-dimensional embedding space. We extend our recent work [2, 4] and propose a novel objective 54 for updating the generator network. We find that optimizing GAN models with this objective proves 55 to be unstable, and propose to stabilize it by augmenting the discriminator with an auxiliary loss 56 function. This strategy also helped stabilize training for the conventional generator objective but was 57 not strictly needed. Additionally, we analyze the transformed source and target data distributions in order to gain further 59 insight regarding the performance of our method. We measure distances between these distributions 60 using Maximum Mean Discrepancy and Fr\\u00e9chet distances. From our analysis we see that a good 61 performance in terms of distributional distance corresponds to good verification performance. Our 62 speaker verification experiments show that the proposed adversarial speaker embedding framework 63 delivers robust performance, significantly outperforming a strong i-vector baseline. Furthermore, by 64 averaging the scores of our different GAN models, we are able to achieve state-of-the-art results. The first step for learning discriminative speaker embeddings is to learn a mapping DISPLAYFORM0 D from a sequence of speech frames from speaker s to a D-dimensional feature vector f. F (X) 69 can be implemented using a variety of neural network architectures. We design our feature extractor 70 using a residual network structure. We choose to model speech using 1-dimensional convolutional 71 filters, owing to the fact that speech is translation invariant along the time-axis only. Following the 72 residual blocks we use a combination of self-attention and dense layers in order to represent input 73 audio of arbitrary size by a fixed-size vector, f. Unlike traditional approaches, our proposed feature 74 extractor is updated with an adversarial loss in addition to the standard task loss. Self-Attention models are an active area of research in the speaker verification community. Intuitively, such models allow the network to focus on fragments of speech that are more speaker discriminative. The attention layers computes a scalar weight corresponding to each time-step t: DISPLAYFORM0 These weights are then normalized, \\u03b1 t = sof tmax(e t ), to give them a probabilistic interpretation. We use the attention model proposed in [25] , which extends attention to the mean as well as standard DISPLAYFORM0 DISPLAYFORM1 In this work we apply the use of self attention to convolutional feature maps, as indicated in Fig. 1 . The last residual block outputs a tensor of size n B \\u00d7 n F \\u00d7 T , where n B is the batch size, n F is the 84 number of filters and T is time. The input to the attention layer, h t , is a n F dimensional vector. By using a self-attention model, we also equip our network with a more robust framework for computes similarity between classes using cosine, and forces the similarity of the correct class to be 94 greater than that of incorrect classes by a margin m. discriminator D, which is trained using the Binary Cross-Entropy loss (BCE). DISPLAYFORM0 DISPLAYFORM1 Where X s , X t represent source and target data respectively. E(.) is the feature extractor/generator. The adversarial game between D(.) and E(.) is given by: DISPLAYFORM0 Equation FORMULA6 represents the most general form of the GAN game, and can be used to represent 112 different adversarial frameworks depending on the choice of L adv E . Gradient Reversal: We obtain the gradient reversal framework by setting DISPLAYFORM0 Gradient reversal optimizes the true minmax objective of the adversarial game BID0 . However, this 115 objective can become problematic, since the discriminator converges early during training and leads 116 to vanishing gradients. We refer to the model trained with gradient reversal as Domain Adversarial Neural Speaker Embeddings (DANSE). GAN: Rather than directly using the minimax loss, the standard way to train the generator is using 119 the inverted label loss. The generator objective is given by: DISPLAYFORM0 This splits the optimization into two independent objectives, one for the generator and one for the In a typical GAN setting, the generator is trained only using fake data (with inverted labels). This 125 structure is also maintained in several adversarial domain adaptation algorithms. However, in the 126 context of this work we believe that updating the generator using both source and target data can be 127 beneficial. In this case, the generator loss simply inverts the discriminator loss of eq. (1): DISPLAYFORM0 DISPLAYFORM1 Eq. FORMULA10 DISPLAYFORM2 In order to quantitatively evaluate our models in terms of domain adaptation, we measure the Inception network, we extract embeddings from our gan models from the source and target data. The Fr\\u00e9chet Distance between between the Gaussian (m s ,C s ) obtained from the source data distribution 225 p s and the Gaussian (m t ,C t ) from the target data is given by: DISPLAYFORM0 Source Domain Speaker Verification: We use the same source data used to compute the MMD and shows the best performance on this experiment albeit by a small margin. In this work we we presented a novel framework for learning domain-invariant speaker embeddings\",\n          \"This is an empirical paper which constructs color invariant networks and evaluates their performances on a realistic data set. The paper studies the simplest possible case of color invariance: invariance under pixel-wise permutation of the color channels. Thus the network is aware not of the specific color object, but its colorfulness. The data set introduced in the paper consists of images showing crashed cars from which ten classes were extracted. An additional annotation was done which labeled whether the car shown was red or non-red.   The networks were evaluated by their performance on the classification task. With the color annotation we altered the color ratios  in the training data and analyzed the generalization capabilities of the networks on the unaltered test data. We further split the test data in red and non-red cars and did a similar evaluation. It is shown in the paper that an pixel-wise ordering of the rgb-values of the images performs better or at least similarly for small deviations from the true color ratios. The limits of these networks are also discussed. Imagine a training set without red objects, and a test set which contains red objects. How well does a trained net perform? This is not a mere academic question. Imagine we want to separate cars, humans and free space for an autonomous driving task. If our data contained red cars but not red trousers say, it will most likely classify legs as cars. Even worse it could mix up yellow markings and yellow trouser and classify an human as free space. On the other hand we can not disregard color all together as it yields some clues for natural objects such as trees, sky, mist, snow and also some man made objects such as markings, or traffic signs. The first thing that comes to mind is to balance the color statistics of our data set. But this impossible to do in practice, and worse at training time it is unknown which colors will become fashion in say five years. What is called for is network which is invariant under color changes. In this paper we construct and analyze such a network. The paper begins with some remarks on the literature in Section 2. This is followed by Section 3 which discusses different variants of color invariant networks and evaluates them on cifar10. Section 4 is the main contribution of the paper. The crashed cars data set is introduced. And and the best color invariant function of the previous section is evaluated on this data set. The paper closes with a conclusion in Section 5. In Appendix A more details on the data sets can be found. This is followed by Appendix B which collects some plots and figures which did not fit in the main text. Finally, Appendix explores the limits of color invariance. In this review section we first discuss invariance in general, then we point to some recent papers which discuss various variants of invariance. This is followed by a brief discussion of equivariance. Then we point the reader to color invariance. Finally we mention some work on the evaluation of invariance. Let us denote our data by X, our target space by Y and our network by \\u03c6 : X \\u2192 Y . In the paper X is an image and Y the finite set of classes. To discuss invariance, we consider a transformation T : X \\u2192 X on our data space. We say that a net is invariant under such a transformation T provided that \\u03c8(x) = \\u03c8(T (x)).Putting invariance in a network is an classical question of neural networks. In Section 8.7 of Bishop (1997) we find the following advises to ensure invariance: by example, by pre-processing, through structure. If the training data has some invariance it is hoped that the net learns to this invariance. We can enforce this by cropping at random, flipping or adding noise to the training images. Color normalization falls into preprocessing, the images are invariant under (some) changes of intensity or luminosity. Structural invariance could for example be enforced by radial basis functions, which may not apply directly to images. A different structural invariance is max pooling. Through a cascade of max pooling layers the networks become invariant under small movements of the image plane. Together with cropping this ensures heuristically the translation invariance in image classification. In Bishop (1997) we find some further hints to the classical literature. Another popular recent architecture which is related to invariance are spatial transformer networks introduced by BID7 . Here the transformer network is specialized to normalize the input image by scaling, translating, rotating and so on. This makes the input data empirically stable under such transformations. More general, all types of normalizing layers can be seen as such an invariance enforcing unit. In BID14 translation and rotation invariance nets are constructed by patch reordering based on some energy. What is nice about this approach is that this extends the local spatial invariance of max-pooling to a much larger scale. Let us also mention BID10 in which rotational invariant networks are constructed. Invariance is closely related to nuisances. Nuisances are properties of the object which are irrelevant to classification. They are in depth discussed in BID15 . Typically they are countered by extending the data set as recommended above. This is done for example in BID3 with computer models of chairs or in BID11 with real images. Their exists many more examples. Sometimes it is more desirable that the net is aware of these transformation. This can be achieved by the related concept of equivariance. Contrary to invariance, equivariant networks are aware of the transformation, thus there exists a transformation T on the target space such that \\u03c8(T (x)) = T \\u03c8(x). Ideally, both transformations are a groups, such as one of the wallpaper groups. It is possible to extend convolution and pooling to the group setting. For more on this we refer to BID2 .There exists a deep theory of color invariance derived from physical principles, see for example BID4 . An performance evaluation of color invariance was done by BID1 . We cite these papers to remind us that color invariance is much more just the invariance under pixel permutation of the color channels as discussed in the present paper. Typically, classical papers discussing color invariants look at invariance under color changes of the SIFT features. A more recent empirical study of invariance of deep neural nets can be found in BID5 . In the paper the idea is promoted that invariance in deep neural nets can only be empirically evaluated by activation of neurons. This evaluation scheme is applied for example by BID14 . Finally, BID13 followed a different path by evaluating invariance with synthetic images. In this paper we say that a function is pixel-wise color invariant if a permutation of the color channels of any pixel does not change the outcome of the function. For what follows we will simply speak of a color invariant function, when we actually mean pixel-wise color invariant. It thus suffices to discuss invariance of a function which depends on three parameters. There are several ways to make such a function invariant under permutation of its inputs. Formally we can write this as p(x, y, z) = p(\\u03c3(x, y, z)). In this paper we analyzed the symmetric polynomials p 1 (x, y, z) = Figure 1 : The invariant functions discussed in paper applied to the yellow car on the upper left. In the first row from the left: original image, the first symmetric polynomial, the second symmetric polynomial, the third symmetric polynomial. In the second row: all symmetric polynomials, pixelwise maximum, pixel-wise minimum and the ordered network x + y + z, p 2 (x, y, z) = xy + yz + yz and p 3 (x, y, z) = xyz, and variants of sorting: q 1 = max{x, y, z}, q 2 = min{x, y, z}, q 3 = sort{x, y, z}. It is obvious that these functions are invariant under permutations of its inputs. So for instance p 1 (x, y, z) = p 1 (y, z, x) and so on. We could also consider linear combinations of these function. We did this only for the symmetric functions. In Figure 1 we applied all permutation invariant functions to the yellow car shown on the upper left. Cifar10 introduced by BID8 ) is a popular data set which has been chosen for the analysis in this section. As baseline we implemented tensorflow's cifar10 architecture, as can be found at Google. So the baseline net, let us denote it by \\u03c8, takes an image x and outputs its class y = \\u03c8(x, w). The invariant nets are almost similar. Instead of passing the image directly to the net, the images are made invariant by first applying one of the functions mention above followed by the architecture of the baseline. So, y = \\u03c8(p(x),w). We call the different architectures the p 1 -net, the p 2 -net and so on. Training. We trained the net for 249999 iterations. This is longer as suggested in the tutorial, but as we did not change any of the training parameters we gave the nets some more time to converge. Table shows the accuracy after 249999 iterations. Results and Discussion. Comparing the gray net (the p 1 -net) to the baseline we see a drop in accuracy. We interpret this that color gives some clues to the classifier and can not entirely be omitted. Still it is not a dominant factor as the drop is not that dramatic. The other symmetric functions have a significant drop in accuracy. The accuracy did not increase if all three symmetric functions were considered. Surprisingly, the maximum and the minimum function contain lots of information. Finally, sorting achieved similar results on the test set as the baseline. So it seems that colorfulness of the input image provides enough information for classification. The previous section showed that a net which pixel-wise orders the color channels performs similar to a baseline net on cifar10. Let us call such a net an order network. In a second set of more involved experiments we compared order networks to a baseline on a more realistic data set. To this end we extracted a data set from the NHTSA which compiles accident reports during the years 2004-2010 in the US, United States Department of Transportation (2017). The data set was split in train and test set and consists of around 158000 images of 37000 cars. These car are categorized by the NHTSA in several body type classes. The task of the nets was to classify the body type of the car from the image. In addition we annotated whether the car shown in the image is red or not. With this additional annotation we could fix the ratio of red cars in the training data and perform some experiments with varying color analyzing the invariance properties of the nets. More on the data set is described in the appendix. Since 1972, NCSA's Special Crash Investigations (SCI) Program has provided NHTSA with the most in-depth and detailed level of crash investigation data collected by the agency. 1 For this paper we obtained images from the website of the agency. These images show crashed cars from the years 2004 -2010. Each image is provided with the body type of the car shown, TAB1 . We selected full view images of the ten most frequent body types. Figure 2 shows one image of each body type class. As the baseline model we have chosen an alexnet type network BID9 . We did some experiments, not reported here, which varied the size of the net, the size of the fully connected layer, and the points of weight regularization. As a result of these experiments we reduced the size of the fully connected layers to 256 instead of usual 4096, added batch normalization, and l 2 -regularization on the weights of the last layer to reduce over-fitting. The reason for choosing alexnet was due to its reasonable convergence time which allowed several experiments. Network architectures. Figure 3 shows the principal architectures of the networks analyzed in the paper. The baseline network, a variant of alexnet, inputs an image of a car and outputs the corresponding class. The color invariant networks of the paper, are of identical structure, except of an additional inv-block. The inv block is applied to the image and then passed through the alexnet architecture outputting the corresponding class. In this paper two variants have been analyzed, one which just orders the rgb-values of each pixel, and a second which applies first an 3x3x3x3 convolution to the input image, and then orders pixel-wise. Naming conventions. In this paper we denote the standard nets by rgb-nets. We call nets which pixel-wise order the rgb channels order nets. Finally, the nets which apply a color correction to the image before ordering are called weighted order nets. Training sets. As described in the appendix, we created three groups of training sets, one which contained all cars denoted by all-train, one which contained no red cars, denoted by nored-train and one with uniform ratio of red / non-red cars per class, denoted by even-train. All three nets were trained on the mentioned data sets for 25000 iterations. We did not optimize to train for the specific data, but are interested in the effects if the color distribution changes. In an uncontrolled setting, we are not aware of the specific color distribution, and we can only decide to stop training with the data at hand -it is this what we are mimicking here. Testing sets. In total we created four groups of test sets. One denoted by all-test consisting of a sample of all cars. A second group denoted by nored-test containing no red cars. The third group called red-test, consisting of one hundred sets of red cars only. And the fourth group, called class-test, splitting color and class giving thirty further tests sets. As the distribution of red cars is not uniform over the classes we sub-sampled the first three sets such that each class has the same number of cars. This is not entirely satisfying as rarer classes contained more views of the same car, than larger classes. But this is the best we could do. For the baseline we trained the nets on all-train and evaluated them on our four test sets. Tested on all-test. FIG2 shows the plots of accuracy over iteration. We see from the figure the reason for choosing to stop at 25000 as at this point the rgb-net performs best beating its competitors. But if we look below at the class experiments we see that all three nets perform similarly. As all numbers are in similar range we see that our sub-sampling estimated the true accuracy rather well. Tested on nored-test Figure 11 , in the appendix, shows the plots of accuracy over iteration. Similar to the previous paragraph we see that all three nets behave similar, by again taking the class experiments into account. Tested on red-test The achieved accuracy of the trained nets, were tested on 100 sampled sets consisting of red cars only. We see that the order nets perform 0.03 absolute units better than the baseline net on red cars. FIG3 shows three histograms of the accuracies. The accuracy of the rgb network is 0.5113 \\u00b1 0.0306, the accuracy of the order network is 0.5420 \\u00b1 0.0284, and an accuracy of weighted order network of 0.5411 \\u00b1 0.0280. Tested on class-test FIG4 shows the heat plot of the accuracies per class and test set. From these numbers we may derive the mean and deviation and compare them to the accuracies computed in the previous paragraph. As can be seen the numbers are in a similar range, confirming the conclusions of the previous three experiments. For the readers convenience we derived all the means and standard deviations. The rgb net on all cars has accuracy 0.551 \\u00b1 0.105. The order net on all cars has accuracy 0.553 \\u00b1 0.103. The weighted order net on all cars has accuracy 0.550 \\u00b1 0.115. The rgb net on all non-red cars has accuracy 0.551 \\u00b1 0.106. The order net on all non-red cars has accuracy 0.554 \\u00b1 0.101. The weighted order net on all non-red cars has accuracy 0.551 \\u00b1 0.111. The rgb net on all red cars has accuracy 0.513 \\u00b1 0.123. The order net on all red cars has accuracy 0.545 \\u00b1 0.099. The weighted order net on all red cars has accuracy 0.538 \\u00b1 0.137. For our next analysis we trained the nets on a data set without red cars, denoted nored-train in the paper. All plots except for the heat map can be found in the appendix B.2. We see from the plots that the weighted order net beats both other nets on all cars and on all non-red cars by 0.01 to 0.02 absolute units. On the red cars the order nets beats the other architectures significantly with 0.08 absolute units. The achieved accuracy of the trained nets, were tested on 100 sampled sets consisting of red cars only. FIG2 shows three histograms of the accuracies. The accuracy of the rgb network is 0.3707 \\u00b1 0.0272, the accuracy of the order network is 0.4583 \\u00b1 0.0281, and an accuracy of weighted order network of 0.3864 \\u00b1 0.0280. A plot of the heat map is shown in FIG6 . As a further analysis we may count the times the net beat its competitors. This shows again that the order networks perform better than the baseline. Annotating the images with red / non-red allowed several further experiments. Here we fixed the ratio of red to non-red cars per class and report the achieved accuracies. FIG7 shows the plots of our analysis. For comparison also the baseline as trained and evaluated in Section 4.4 was included in the plots. We see that up to a ratio of 0.4 all nets behave acceptable, with the order nets beating the rgb net. After that the accuracies of all nets drop rapidly. As we are randomly choosing from the test data set, this can also be due to the fact that these cars show only a fraction of the whole dataset. The net were trained on eleven training sets each with a fixed ratio of red / non-red cars per class. In the paper we called this data set even-train. Starting with no red car at 0 on the x-axis and only red cars at 1 on the x-axis. The nets were than evaluated on all-test, non-test and red-test. The baseline was trained on all-train and then evaluated on the corresponding data sets. To analyze this behavior further we computed the deviation of ratios of red cars in even-train to the true ratio as shown in TAB3 . In FIG8 we see that at 0.2 the color ratio in even-train is closest to the true ratio. Looking again at FIG7 we see that at this ratio the weighted nets excel on all data sets, this is due to the color adjustment in the weights. The order net also beats the baseline at this point. Furthermore we see that if we are not to far away from the true ratio, that is between 0.0 and 0.4 the accuracies of the order nets are similar or better than that of the rgb nets. In Appendix C we also report our experiments which trained on a set without red cars except for class 09 which contained red cars only. In the plots shown we see the expected behavior -all nets are not able to learn non-red cars in class 09 and have trouble of detecting red cars in the classes 00-08. We are to far away from the true color ratios, with a deviation of 0.99, and thus the nets fail. We compared different color invariant neural networks. It is shown in the paper that only pixel-wise ordering of the color channels shows similar results on cifar10 (and also on the crashed car data set). To test the hypothesis that ordering is invariant under color changes, a classification task has been extracted from a publicly available crashed car data set. In addition each car was labeled as red or non-red. On this data set it was shown that all three nets showed similar behavior on all cars and on all non-red cars, on the red cars the order nets performed noticeably better. Further, we excluded red cars from the training set, and showed that the weighted order nets performed better than the baseline on all three test sets. On the red cars the order showed significantly better results. Further, we fixed the ratio of red / non-red in the training sets. The order nets perform better or at least similar to the baseline net. All nets degrade noticeable while increasing the ratio red cars. As a teaser we report in the appendix there all three nets fail. No net can cope with one class of entirely red cars and all other classes set to non red. We can also view the paper as an empirical study on generalization: trained nets are tested on a statistically different test set. Most plots of accuracy over iterations on the test set showed overshooting despite of the l 2 regularization in the final layer. The curve of the weighted net in FIG2 being a typical example. We interpret this as over fitting, training should be stopped much earlier. A further empirical conclusion shows that sub-sampling the unevenly distributed test data gave similar results than deriving the accuracies for all class separately and then taking the mean. But the individual class may perform rather poor, an insight which is lost in sub-sampling. The paper introduced and evaluated a variant of color invariant nets. The constructed nets are invariant under pixel-wise permutation of the color channels. Thus the network is aware not of the specific color, but the colorfulness of the object. Further, a data set was introduced which allowed to evaluate color invariance in a realistic setting. We see that the net constructed in the paper are better or equal to the baseline if the color distribution is not to far away from the true distribution. We conclude that colorfulness is enough information for classification. The crash car data set itself calls for further experiments and insights, and remains a tough classification challenge. In this appendix we report some additional information on the crashed car data set. In particular, we briefly discuss why classifying crashed cars is a hard task, give some details on the selection of the cars, the labeling, and on the construction of the training and testing sets. Why it is a hard task. The classification task considered in the paper is hard, as it is sometimes just not possible to decide to which class a shown image belongs. Further complications arise from the data set itself, as it shows sometimes also completely destroyed images, or close up and so on. We did not omitted such images from the data set. FIG9 shows some of the particular challenges the net has to overcome. We did not strive to excel at this task, therefore we did not investigate this any further. Details on car selection. Each case comes along with an xml file giving some meta information. Since we are not interested in say close-ups of the cars, we picked the images with the annotations: Frontleftoblique, Frontrightoblique, Backleftoblique, Backrightoblique, showing the views of the whole car. We further included the labels: side, left, right, overhead, front, back, down, middoor, oblique and excluded the labels tire, mirror, handle, filler, wheel, door, visor, dash, seat, tank, grass, tin, gauge. For the paper we manually annotated whether the car shown is red and non-red. Details of labeling. We looked at several views of a car and manually labeled whether the car is red or not. We did this for the training data set as well as for the test data. In addition we experimented by selecting three pixel of the image showing the color of the car, but we decided against it for this paper, as this color detection should again be checked against a manually labeled data set. Label error and noise. We estimate our label error to be 0.01. The estimation was done by reevaluating the labeled non red images and counting the number of red images found. So in reality one out of 100 cars in the images is actually red. Furthermore, potentially there are red cars in the background or red cars appears through reflection. For training we took images from the years . In total there are 31918 cars and 135843 images in the training set. We generated three different groups of training sets. The first group denoted by all-train consists of an evenly distributed sample of the training data of all cars. The second group denoted by nonred-train consists of an evenly distributed sample of the training data of all non-red cars. The third group denoted by even-train consists of randomly chosen images from the training data with a fixed frequency of non-red to red images per class. Some images were not blacklisted due to errors in the jpg. In the statistics below such images are still included. The set all-train. For each class we sampled 2500 images from the training data. This lead in total to 25000 images collected in the set all-train. Sneaking at the statistics we see that there are 2861 images of class 00 in our training data. This lead to our present choice of samples size. The set nored-train. The data set nored-train consists of a sample of 2404 non red images per class. The set even-train. In total there are ten data sets denoted by even010, ... , even100. For each class we collected all non-red images and all red images. To generate the data sets, we sampled p * N from the red images and (1 \\u2212 p) * N from the non red images. In our experiments we have set N = 3000 and varied p from 0.1 to 1.0.Overall statistics of training data. In TAB2 we list the statistics of the training data. TAB3 shows the number of images per class of the training data. We observe that all ratios are in a similar range. Each car has roughly four different views, 14 % of all cars and images are red. The set all-test. The set all-test consists of a sample of 323 images per class of all cars of the test set. In total there are 3230 images in this set. As a motivation for these number we look at the statistics of the test set and see that there are 323 images in class 00.The set nonred-test. The set nonred-test consists of a sample of 273 images per class of non-red cars of the test set. In total there are 2730 images in this set. The limiting number is again the number of non-red images of class 00.The sets red-test. Looking again at the statistics we see that there are 25 red images in class 05. This would result in a rather small test set. Therefore we sampled one hundred sets consisting of 25 images per class. In total each of the sets consists of 250 images. Overall statistics of test data. TAB5 lists the number of cars per classes, the percentages with respect to all cars, as well as the number of red cars of the test set. We see that most cars in the class 09 the 4-door sedan. Furthermore, we read of the table that sport cars, which typically have three doors and thus fall in class 02, are more likely to be red than the average car. TAB6 lists the number of images per class. We see that the percentages of cars and image coincides. In this appendix we show further plots which did not fit in the paper. Figure 11 shows the plots of the nets trained on all-train and tested on nonred-test of Section 4.4. As a teaser we want to report also a case at which non of the nets perform that well if we take a closer look. In this setting there are no red cars in the training set except for class 09 which consists of red cars only. A first look at the performance of all cars we see a overall drop in accuracy by roughly 0.10 absolute units, FIG3 . Tested on non-red cars the performance was better, with a drop by 0.05 absolute units, FIG4 . Looking at the color histograms already reveals that all nets behave poorly on the red cars, FIG6 . Finally, what is really happening is visible in FIG7 . The red cars of class 09 are classified almost with perfection. On the other classes the performance of all nets is poor. As we are randomly choosing from the test data set, this could also be due to the fact that these cars show only a fraction of the whole dataset. FIG4 : The net was trained on allred-in09-train and tested on nored-test. This shows the accuracy over the iteration in table and plot. The net was trained on all cars and tested on the non red ars. The highlighted row shows the 25000 iteration at which all results are analyzed. FIG7 : The nets were trained on allred09-train. This shows the accuracy as measured on the thirty class data sets. Each row represents on of the bodytype classes numbered 00 to 09. The columns of the blocks represent the rgb-network the order network and the weighted order network. The block on the left are the accuracies computed on all cars. The block in the middle the non-red cars, and the block on the right are the accuracies computed on all red cars.\",\n          \"Neural network-based systems can now learn to locate the referents of words and phrases in images, answer questions about visual scenes, and even execute symbolic instructions as first-person actors in partially-observable worlds. To achieve this so-called grounded language learning, models must overcome certain well-studied learning challenges that are also fundamental to infants learning their first words. While it is notable that models with no meaningful prior knowledge overcome these learning obstacles, AI researchers and practitioners currently lack a clear understanding of exactly how they do so. Here we address this question as a way of achieving a clearer general understanding of grounded language learning, both to inform future research and to improve confidence in model predictions. For maximum control and generality, we focus on a simple neural network-based language learning agent trained via policy-gradient methods to interpret synthetic linguistic instructions in a simulated 3D world. We apply experimental paradigms from developmental psychology to this agent, exploring the conditions under which established human biases and learning effects emerge. We further propose a novel way to visualise and analyse semantic representation in grounded language learning agents that yields a plausible computational account of the observed effects. The learning challenge faced by children acquiring their first words has long fascinated cognitive scientists and philosophers BID34 BID5 . To start making sense of language, an infant must induce structure in a constant stream of continuous visual input, slowly reconcile this structure with consistencies in the available linguistic observations, store this knowledge in memory, and apply it to inform decisions about how best to respond. Many neural network models also overcome a learning task that is -to varying degrees -analogous to early human word learning. Image classification tasks such as the ImageNet Challenge BID8 ) require models to induce discrete semantic classes, in many cases aligned to words, from unstructured pixel representations of large quantities of photographs BID20 . Visual question answering (VQA) systems BID0 BID41 BID42 ) must reconcile raw images with (arbitrary-length) sequences of symbols, in the form of natural language questions, in order to predict lexical or phrasal answers. Recently, situated language learning agents have been developed that learn to understand sequences of linguistic symbols not only in terms of the contemporaneous raw visual input, but also in terms of past visual input and the actions required to execute an appropriate motor response BID29 BID6 BID15 BID26 . The most advanced such agents learn to execute a range of phrasal and multi-task instructions, such as find the green object in the red room, pick up the pencil in the third room on the right or go to the small green torch, in a continous, simulated 3D world. To solve these tasks, an agent must execute sequences of hundreds of fine-grained actions, conditioned on the available sequence of language symbols and active (first-person) visual perception of the surroundings. Importantly, the knowledge acquired by such agents while mastering these tasks also permits the interpretation of familiar language in entirely novel surroundings, and the execution of novel instructions composed of combinations of familiar words BID6 BID15 .The potential impact of situated linguistic agents, VQA models and other grounded language learning systems is vast, as a basis for human users to interact with situated learning applications such as self-driving cars and domestic robotic tools. However, our understanding of how these agents learn and behave is limited. The challenges of interpreting the factors or reasoning behind the decisions and predictions of neural networks are well known. Indeed, a concerted body of research in both computer vision BID44 BID38 BID43 and natural language processing BID23 BID39 has focused on addressing this uncertainty. As grounded language learning agents become more prevalent, then, understanding their learning dynamics, representation and decision-making will become increasingly important, both to inform future research and to build confidence in users who interact with such models. We therefore aim to establish a better understanding of neural network-based models of grounded language learning, noting the parallels with research in neuroscience and psychology that aims to understand human language acquisition. Extending the approach of BID35 , we adapt various experimental techniques initially developed by experimental psychologists BID21 BID24 BID17 BID7 . In line with typical experiments on humans, our experimental simulations are conducted in a highly controlled environment: a simulated 3D world with a limited set of objects and properties, and corresponding unambiguous, symbolic linguistic stimuli (Figure 1) . However, the simplicity and generality of our architecture and the form of the inputs to the model (continuous visual plus symbolic linguistic) make the proposed methods and approach directly applicable to VQA and other tasks that combine linguistic and visual data. Using these methods, we explore how the training environment of our agent affects its learning outcomes and speed, measure the generality and robustness of its understanding of certain fundamental linguistic concepts, and test for biases in the decisions it takes once trained. Further, by applying layerwise attention, a novel tool for visualising computation in grounded language learning models, we obtain a plausible algorithmic account of some of the effects in terms of representation and processing. Our principal findings about this canonical grounded language learning architecture are the following:Shape / colour biases When the agent is trained on an equal number of shape and colour words, it develops a propensity to extend labels for ambiguous new words according to colour rather than shape (color bias). A human-like bias towards shapes can be induced in the agent, but only if it experiences many more shape terms than colour terms during training. The problem of learning negation The agent learns to execute negated instructions, but if trained on small amounts of data it tends to represent negation in an ad hoc way that does not generalise. Curriculum effects for vocabulary growth The agent learns words more quickly if the range of words to which it is exposed is limited at first and expanded gradually as its vocabulary develops. Semantic processing and representation differences The agent learns words of different semantic classes at different speeds and represents them with features that require different degrees of visual processing depth (or abstraction) to compute. Before describing the experiments that reveal these effects, we briefly outline details of the environment and agent used for the simulations. Our experiments take place in the DeepMind Lab simulated world BID1 , modified to include a language channel. An agent in this environment receives textual instructions, such as find the pencil, and is rewarded for satisfying the instruction, in this case by executing movement actions (move-left, turn right etc.) that allow it to locate a (3D, rotating) pencil and move into the space that it occupies. At each timestep in such an episode, the agent receives a continuous (RGB) pixel tensor of visual input and a symbolic (word-level) textual instruction, 1 and must execute a movement action. To solve tasks and receive rewards, the agent must therefore first learn to perceive this environment, actively controlling what it sees via movement of its head (turning actions), and to navigate its surroundings via meaningful sequences of actions. A typical simulation involves specifying certain aspects of the environment while leaving others to be determined randomly. For instance, in an object identification task, we might wish to specify the overall layout of the world, the range of positions in which objects can appear, a list of objects that can appear in each position, a probability of appearance and rewards associated with selecting each object. The environment engine is then responsible for randomly instantiating episodes that satisfy these constraints together with corresponding language instructions. Even with a detailed specification and a finite inventory of objects, properties and instruction words, there are tens of millions of unique episodes that the agent can encounter during training, each involving different object shapes, colours, patterns, shades, sizes and/or relative positions. With respect to the goal of understanding models of grounded language learning, this simulated environment and synthetic language is a useful asset: we can straightforwardly apply the methods of behavioural psychologists, testing how agents respond to precisely crafted training and test stimuli.3 A SITUATED LANGUAGE LEARNING AGENT Figure 1 : Left: Schematic agent architecture. Right: An example of the word learning environment common to all experiments in this paper. The agent observes two 3D rotating objects and a language instruction and must select the object that matches the instruction. In this case the instruction is a shape word (chair). The confounding object (a refrigerator) and the colours of both objects are selected at random and will vary across the agent's experience of the word chair. For maximum generality, our simulations involve an agent that combines standard modules for processing sequential symbolic input (a recurrent network) and visual input (a convolutional network). At each time step t, the visual input v t is encoded by the convolutional vision module V and a recurrent (LSTM, BID16 ) language module L encodes the instruction string l t . A mixing module M determines how these signals are combined before they are passed to a LSTM action module A: here M is simply a feedforward linear layer operating on the concatenation of the output from V and L. The hidden state s t of A is fed to a policy function, which computes a probability distribution over possible motor actions \\u03c0(a t |s t ), and a state-value function approximator Val(s t ), which computes a scalar estimate of the agent value function for optimisation. Val estimates the expected discounted future return, by approximating the state-value function DISPLAYFORM0 where S t is the state of the environment at time t when following policy \\u03c0 and r t is the reward received following the action performed at time t. 0 \\u2264 \\u03bb \\u2264 1 represents a discount parameter. Note that this architecture is a simplified version of that proposed by BID15 , without auxiliary learning components. Weight updates are computed according to the asynchronous advantage actor-critic (A3C) algorithm BID27 , in conjunction with the RMSProp update rule BID40 . During training, a single parameter vector is shared across 16 CPU cores, which offers a suitable tradeoff between training time and loss of accuracy due to the asynchronous updates. One effect that is considered instrumental in allowing children to overcome the challenges of early word learning is the human shape bias BID21 , whereby infants tend to to presume that novel words refer to the shape of an unfamiliar object rather than, for instance, its colour, size or texture. Our simulated environment permits the replication of the original experiment by BID21 designed to demonstrate the shape bias in humans. During training, the agent learns word meanings in a room containing two objects, one that matches the instruction word (positive reward) and a confounding object that does not (negative reward). Using this method, the agent is taught the meaning of a set C of colour terms, S of shape terms and A of ambiguous terms (in the original experiment, the terms a \\u2208 A were the nonsense terms 'dax' and 'riff'). The target referent for a shape term s \\u2208 S can be of any colour c \\u2208 C and, similarly, the target referent when learning the colours in C can be of any shape. In contrast, the ambiguous terms in A always correspond to objects with a specific colour c a / \\u2208 C and shape s a / \\u2208 S (e.g. 'dax' always referred to a black pencil, and neither black nor pencils were observed in any other context) . Note also that colour terms refer to a range of RGB space through the application of Gaussian noise to prototypical RGB codes, so that two instances of red objects will have subtly different colours. As the agent learns, we periodically measure its bias by means of test episodes for which no learning takes place. In a test episode, the agent receives an instruction a \\u2208 A ('dax') and must decide between two objects, o 1 , whose shape is s a and whose colour is\\u0109 / \\u2208 C \\u222a {c a } (a blue pencil), and o 2 , whose shape is\\u015d / \\u2208 S \\u222a {s a } and whose colour is c a (a black fork). Note that in the present example neither the colour blue nor the shape fork are observed by the agent during training. As with the original human experiment, the degree of shape bias in the agent can be measured, as the agent is learning, by its propensity to select o 1 in preference to o 2 . Moreover, by varying the size of sets S and C, we can examine the effect of different training regimes on this bias exhibited by the agent. Figure 2 illustrates how a shape/colour bias develops in agents exposed to three different training regimes. An agent that is taught exclusively colour words (| S |= 0, | C |= 8) unsurprisingly develops a strong colour bias. More interestingly, an agent that is taught an equal number of shape and colour terms (| S |= 8, | C |= 8) develops a colour bias. This suggests that the canonical architecture employed in our agent (convolutional vision network combined with language instruction embedding) naturally promotes a colour bias. In order to induce a (human-like) shape bias, it was necessary to train the agent exclusively on a larger set of (| S |= 20, | C |= 0) shapes before it began to exhibit a notable shape bias. The fact that the network so readily develops biases that are pertinent to word learning provides insight into established effects of neural networks such as rapid acceleration of word learning (see e.g. BID33 ; BID15 ); it is precisely the progressive specialisation of the agent's object recognition and labelling mechanisms (towards shapes, colours or both, as determined by the training regime) that narrows the space of possible referents, permitting faster word learning as training progresses. These conclusions can be incorporated with those of BID35 , who observe a shape bias in convolutional networks trained on the ImageNet Challenge training set. Our experiments with a single canonical architecture exposed to different training stimuli indicate the cause of this effect to be the training data distribution (the ImageNet data indeed contains many more shape-based than colourbased categories) rather than the convolutional architecture itself. Indeed, our findings suggest that a feed-forward convolutional architecture operating (bottom-up) on image pixels promotes a colour rather than shape bias. On the other hand, a typical linguistic environment (for American children at least 3 ) and, perhaps by extension, most broad-coverage machine-learning datasets, contains many more instances of shape categories than colour categories. Figure 2: Degrees of shape bias for different training regimes: An agent that is trained only on shape words (right) more readily presumes that ambiguous words refer to object shape than to object colour. This tendency is measured across all combinations of known and confounding objects and labels and represented by the blue line. The magnitude of the bias on the scale [\\u221210, 10] is the mean 'score' (10 for the object matching the instruction in shape and 10 for the object matching in colour) over 1000 random test episodes. In contrast, an agent trained only on colour words (left) exhibits a colour bias. Interestingly, an agent trained on 8 colour and 8 shape words (middle) also exhibits a colour bias. Data (in this and proceeding figures) show mean and standard error across five fastest-learning agents of 16 different hyperparameter settings, sampled at random from ranges specified in in supplementary material 6.1. The interpretation of negated sentences such as tell me a joke that is not offensive is a fundamental facet of natural language understanding, and potentially critical for artificial agents receiving instructions from human users. Despite its communicative importance, negation can be challenging to acquire for human language learners. For instance, negated utterances pose greater production and comprehension difficulties than the equivalent non-negated language BID28 BID32 . To explore the acquisition of negation in grounded language learning models, we designed a simulation in which, as before, our agent was placed in a single room and required to select one of two objects matching an instruction. From a full set of training words I (e.g. red or ball), a subset, I 1 \\u2282 I, was sampled and presented to the agent in both positive and negative forms (ball, not ball) and a disjoint subset, I 2 \\u2282 I, was provided only in positive forms (pencil). To test whether the agent could learn to understand the instruction form pick something that is not an X in a generally applicable way, we periodically measured its ability to interpret negated versions of the instructions in I 2 .As illustrated in Figure 3 , the agent learned to follow both positive and negative instructions, for various sets of instruction words I. However, unlike other linguistic operations such as adjective-noun modification BID15 , the agent exhibited difficulty generalising the notion of negation acquired in the context of I 1 to the held-out items I 2 . This difficulty was most acute when I consisted of 12 colour terms split evenly into I 1 and I 2 . Indeed, the ability to generalise negation improved as the size of I increased to include 40 shapes, from just above chance (a small positive average reward) to 75% (yielding an average reward of \\u2248 5/10). There was also a small but interesting difference in generalisation when negating shape terms vs. colour terms, which is consistent with the processing differences discussed above and in more detail in Section 4.4.We conjecture that negation does not generalise easily because, for a word i n \\u2208 I and corresponding extension set of objects s n \\u2208 S, the agent can perform perfectly on the training set by simply associating instructions of the form 'not w' with the extension s 1 \\u222a \\u00b7 \\u00b7 \\u00b7 s n\\u22121 \\u222a s n+1 \\u00b7 \\u00b7 \\u00b7. This understanding of negation would generalise much worse than an interpretation of 'not w' that involved identifying and avoiding an object of type w. For small training sets, the results suggest that the model prefers the former interpretation, but also that its tendency to discover the latter more generalisable understanding increases as the set of negated concepts to which it is exposed grows. Thus, with appropriately broad exposure to instances of negation during training, neural networks without bespoke biases or regularization can learn to respond effectively to negated stimuli pertaining to their perceptible surroundings. However, tailored architectures and computational biases may be required in cases where agents learn from, and act on, constrained sets of linguistic stimuli. Figure 3: The problem of learning negation in language learning agents: The agent must be exposed to negative instructions in a sufficiently diverse range of contexts in order to learn a useful generalisable notion of negation. If trained to interpret positive commands involving 12 terms and negative commands involving 6 of those 12 terms (left, colour terms, middle, shape terms), the agent does not effectively interpret negative commands involving the remaining 6 terms. When exposed to 40 shape terms and trained to interpret negative commands involving 20 of those terms, the agent generalises the negation operation more effectively, but still not perfectly. When the two-word negative instructions are encoded with an LSTM rather than additive BOW encoder, an almost identical pattern of gradually improving generalisation is observed. The idea that learning is more successful if simpler things are studied before more complex things is a basic tenet of human education. There is some consensus that early exposure to simple, clear linguistic input helps child language acquisition BID10 , although this is not unanimous BID37 . Controlled experiments with artificial neural networks trained directly on symbolic (languagelike) data have alse revealed faster or more effective learning when training examples are ordered by some metric of complexity BID9 . This approach is now typically referred to as curriculum learning BID2 ). However, robust improvements due to curriculum learning can be difficult to achieve in the context of text-based learning BID25 BID14 , and curricula are not ordinarily applied when training text-based neural language models. Recent evidence suggests that the benefits of curriculum training can be more easily realised for agents learning to act conditioned on language than those learning to map between linguistic inputs and outputs. Both BID15 and BID29 observed that curricula were essential for agents learning to execute linguistic instructions that require both resolving of referring expressions (get the red ball..) and non-trivial action policies such as exploration (..in the green room).Here, we chose to explore curriculum learning in a more controlled way in grounded language learning agents. To do so, we trained our agent to learn the meaning of 40 shape words (as exhibited by its ability to respond appropriately) under two conditions. In one condition, the agent was presented with the 40 words (together with corresponding target and confounding objects) sampled randomly throughout training. In another condition, the agent was only presented with a subset of the 40 words (selected at random) until these were mastered (as indicated by an average reward of 9.8/10 over 1000 consecutive trials), at which point this subset was expanded to include more words. This process was iterated for subsets of size 2, 5, 10 and eventually 40 words. Figure 4 : Curriculum training expedites vocabulary growth: An agent that is presented with stimuli sampled uniformly from a set S of 40 shape words (red line) learns more slowly than one whose stimuli are constrained to a two-word subset S 1 , S 1 \\u2282 S, until the agent learns both words, then extended to a 5-word subset S 2 , S 1 \\u2282 S 2 \\u2282 S, then a 10-word subset S 3 , S 2 \\u2282 S 3 \\u2282 S. This strong effect of 'curriculum learning' can be observed both when comparing average reward when agents in the two conditions are learning words sampled from S (left -note that the agent in the curriculum condition begins reporting performance on S after prior training on the restricted subsets) and by measuring vocabulary size as a function of training episodes (right). As shown in Figure 4 , an agent that followed the curriculum (i.e. in the second condition) learned notably faster overall than one presented directly with a large group of new words. This result further corroborates the importance of training curricula for grounded language learning agents. Moreover, unlike the effect observed by BID15 , which focused on tasks requiring the agent to explore a large maze, the present simulation demonstrates strong curriculum effects simply when learning to associate objects with words. Thus, the development of core linguistic and semantic knowledge in situated or grounded agents can be clearly expedited by starting small and easy and slowly increasing the language learning challenge faced by the agent. Many studies aiming to understand linguistic processing in humans do so by uncovering connections between different semantic or conceptual domains and distinct processing or patterns of representation. These effects emerge via both behavioural methods (measuring differences in how subjects learn, use or even forget concepts of different types BID4 BID30 ) and neuroimaging (associating words of different types with spatially and structurally distinct brain regions BID19 BID31 ). Neuroscientific theories of memory, representation and learning have been developed to account for these effects BID36 BID3 . In the pursuit of a better understanding of artificial agents, we can similarly explore links between word classes, semantic domains and patterns of learning, behaviour, processing or representation. This knowledge could ultimately be essential for informing the process of designing architectures capable of learning not just the simple language studied here, but also the full range of abstract semantic phenomena inherent in adult language. Word learning speeds The order in which words of different types are acquired has been used to inform theories of child language acquisition BID12 and human semantic processing more generally BID13 . To explore the order of word learning in our agent, we exposed it to randomly interleaved training instances for words of six different classes (shapes, colours, patterns, sizes, shades and superordinate category terms, such as furniture), for multiple shapes. We compared the rates of word learning in two conditions. In the fixed class-size, each class was restricted to two exemplars. In the variable class-size condition, each class was represented by a different number of members, a more faithful reflection of natural language, where one word class (e.g. prepositions) can have a different number of members from another (e.g. nouns). 6 In both conditions, the training stimuli were sampled random uniformly from all word types (not word classes), so that an agent in the variable class-size condition received approximately four times as much exposure to shape words as to colour words, for instance. As illustrated in FIG1 , there were clear differences in the speed with which the agent learned words of different classes. In the fixed class-size condition, the first words to be learned were blue (a colour word) and diagonal-striped (a pattern), with the second colour word, brown, learned around the same time as the two shapes chair and suitcase and the relative size terms larger and smaller. Category terms were learned after shape terms. 7 In contrast, in the variable class-size condition the variable exposure to different word classes seems to cause a degree of specialisation in shape words, so that the agent learns all 40 shape words well before it acquires the 12 colour words. Layer-wise attention To complement our behavioural analysis we developed a method for better understanding semantic processing and representation in the agent. The method, which we call layerwise attention, involves modifying the agent architecture to expose processing differences in the visual features that are most pertinent to each lexical concept. In the standard agent, a distributed representation of the linguistic input is concatenated with the output from the top layer of a 3-layer convolutional visual module at each timestep, fed through a multi-layer perceptron and then passed to the agent's (recurrent) core. We modify this agent so that it can learn to attend to the output from different layers of its visual processing module, conditioned on the linguistic input available at a particular moment. Let e l be the representation of a language instruction l and v i be the output of layer i = 1, 2, 3 of the visual module with dimension n i \\u00d7 n i \\u00d7 k i , where k i is the number of feature maps. In the layerwise attention module, the v i are first passed through 3 independent linear layers to v i with common final dimension n i \\u00d7 n i \\u00d7 K, such that K is also the dimensionality of e l . The v i are then stacked into a single tensor DISPLAYFORM0 . T is then multiplied by e l and passed through a softmax layer to yield a d dimensional discrete probability distribution over all (pixel-like) locations represented in each layer of the visual module V. These values are applied multiplicatively to each of the (k i -dimension) representations returned by V, before a pooling step (mirroring that of the final layer in the original agent) and then concatenation. Layerwise attention provides a measure not only of which image locations contain the most important information for the agent when choosing actions at a given timestep, but also at what level of (visual) abstraction that information is most useful. This insight can be visualised by applying the method of BID38 , propagating the probability mass from the attention distribution back Figure 6 : Representation and processing differences between colour and shape words. ' Dashboards' for interpreting processing in an agent with layerwise attention. The large pane at the top left of the dashboard shows the input to the agent. The bar chart on the bottom left shows the attention distribution over all 520 'locations' from the agent's visual representations. 400 red bars show the attention on the (20 \\u00d7 20) locations output from the lowest layer of the convnet, 81 green bars show the attention on the (9 \\u00d7 9) locations from the middle layer and 49 blue bars show the attention on the (7 \\u00d7 7) locations from the top layer. The small windows on the right side illustrate these attention weights (grouped by layer) propagated back to and superimposed over a greyscale copy of the input image, as described by BID38 . An agent trained exclusively on colour words (A) relies more on the first and second layers of the convnet than an agent trained exclusively on shape words (B), which uses second and upper layer visual features. C: A schematic of layerwise attention in the agent architecture. D: A 2D (t-SNE) visualisation of the space of the word embeddings weights in the language module (L) of an agent trained on different word types, illustrating that words cluster naturally according to semantic classes in the linguistic memory of the agent.onto the input image. Figure 6 illustrates the effect of backpropagating the attention probabilities corresponding to each layer of the convnet onto (grayscale copies of) the visual input.8 As is clear from these visualisations, an agent that is exposed only to shape words will learn to rely on features from the upper-most layers of its visual module when considering objects in its surroundings. In contrast, an agent trained to interpret only colour terms focuses with feature detectors from the lower layers of its visual module in order to distinguish between objects of interest. It is well established that convolutional networks trained to classify images also exhibit differential specialisation of feature detectors between layers (see e.g. BID22 quantify the magnitude of this specialisation, and to measure the importance of each layer with respect to particular linguistic stimuli. It is also notable that a more conventional 2D (T-SNE) visualisation of the word embeddings in the input layer of L provides further evidence of of word-class-specific processing, as illustrated in Figure 6 . Models that are capable of grounded language learning promise to significantly advance the ways in which humans and intelligent technology can interact. In this study, we have explored how a situated language learning agent built from canonical neural-network components overcomes the challenge of early language learning. We measured the behaviour exhibited once the first words and simple phrases are acquired, tested factors that speed up this learning, explored aspects of language that pose particular problems and presented a technique, layerwise attention, for better understanding semantic and visual processing in such agents. The application of experimental paradigms from cognitive psychology to better understand deep neural nets was proposed by BID35 , who observed that convolutional architectures exhibit a shape bias when trained on the ImageNet Challenge data. The ability to control precisely both training and test stimuli in our simulated environment allowed us to isolate this effect as deriving from the training data, and indeed to reach the opposite conclusion about the architecture itself. This study also goes beyond that of BID35 in exploring more abstract linguistic operations (negation, abstract category terms) and studying curriculum effects on the dynamics of word learning. Further, we complement these behavioural observations with computatoinal analysis of representation and processing, via layerwise attention. While the control and precision afforded by the simulated environment in the present study has made these analyses and conclusions possible, in future, as our understanding of language learning agents develops, it will be essential to verify conclusions on agents trained on more naturalistic data. At first, this might involve curated sets of images, videos and naturally-occurring text etc, and, ultimately, experiments on robots trained to communicate about perceptible surroundings with human interlocutors. In a world with agents capable of learning such advanced linguistic behaviour, it would certainly be more challenging, but also even more crucial, to understand not just what they can do, but also how they learn to do it. 6 SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"paper_id\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Byx4xH3is7\",\n          \"BkoCeqgR-\",\n          \"ByZmGjkA-\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"target\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Speaker verificaiton performance can be significantly improved by adapting the model to in-domain data using Generative Adversarial Networks.

We combine adversarial training with an angular margin loss function, which encourages the speaker embedding model to be discriminative by directly optimizing for cosine similarity between classes. In an attempt to better understand this behavior, we quantitatively measure the degree of invariance induced by our proposed methods using Maximum Mean Discrepancy and Frechet distances. Our analysis shows that our proposed adversarial speaker embedding models significantly reduce the distance between source and target data distributions, while performing similarly on the former and better on the latter. We drawn inspiration from research in computer vision, 48 where GAN based unsupervised domain adaptation methods have been extremely successful BID0 21, 49 18, 19], and adapt these ideas for feature learning in a verification setting. The basic idea is cast 50 domain adaptation/invariance as an adversarial game -generate features or embeddings such that a 51 discriminator cannot tell if they come from the source or target domain. We extend our recent work [2, 4] and propose a novel objective 54 for updating the generator network. This strategy also helped stabilize training for the conventional generator objective but was 57 not strictly needed. The first step for learning discriminative speaker embeddings is to learn a mapping DISPLAYFORM0 D from a sequence of speech frames from speaker s to a D-dimensional feature vector f. F (X) 69 can be implemented using a variety of neural network architectures. Following the 72 residual blocks we use a combination of self-attention and dense layers in order to represent input 73 audio of arbitrary size by a fixed-size vector, f. Unlike traditional approaches, our proposed feature 74 extractor is updated with an adversarial loss in addition to the standard task loss. such models allow the network to focus on fragments of speech that are more speaker discriminative. The attention layers computes a scalar weight corresponding to each time-step t: DISPLAYFORM0 These weights are then normalized, \\u03b1 t = sof tmax(e t ), to give them a probabilistic interpretation.

Through a cascade of max pooling layers the networks become invariant under small movements of the image plane. We interpret this that color gives some clues to the classifier and can not entirely be omitted. The previous section showed that a net which pixel-wise orders the color channels performs similar to a baseline net on cifar10. The third group called red-test, consisting of one hundred sets of red cars only. This is not entirely satisfying as rarer classes contained more views of the same car, than larger classes. Similar to the previous paragraph we see that all three nets behave similar, by again taking the class experiments into account. As a further analysis we may count the times the net beat its competitors. In FIG8 we see that at 0.2 the color ratio in even-train is closest to the true ratio. In the plots shown we see the expected behavior -all nets are not able to learn non-red cars in class 09 and have trouble of detecting red cars in the classes 00-08. To test the hypothesis that ordering is invariant under color changes, a classification task has been extracted from a publicly available crashed car data set. On this data set it was shown that all three nets showed similar behavior on all cars and on all non-red cars, on the red cars the order nets performed noticeably better. Most plots of accuracy over iterations on the test set showed overshooting despite of the l 2 regularization in the final layer. In particular, we briefly discuss why classifying crashed cars is a hard task, give some details on the selection of the cars, the labeling, and on the construction of the training and testing sets. In addition we experimented by selecting three pixel of the image showing the color of the car, but we decided against it for this paper, as this color detection should again be checked against a manually labeled data set. The third group denoted by even-train consists of randomly chosen images from the training data with a fixed frequency of non-red to red images per class.\",\n          \"Here we address this question as a way of achieving a clearer general understanding of grounded language learning, both to inform future research and to improve confidence in model predictions. Image classification tasks such as the ImageNet Challenge BID8 ) require models to induce discrete semantic classes, in many cases aligned to words, from unstructured pixel representations of large quantities of photographs BID20 . Importantly, the knowledge acquired by such agents while mastering these tasks also permits the interpretation of familiar language in entirely novel surroundings, and the execution of novel instructions composed of combinations of familiar words BID6 BID15 .The potential impact of situated linguistic agents, VQA models and other grounded language learning systems is vast, as a basis for human users to interact with situated learning applications such as self-driving cars and domestic robotic tools. Our principal findings about this canonical grounded language learning architecture are the following:Shape / colour biases When the agent is trained on an equal number of shape and colour words, it develops a propensity to extend labels for ambiguous new words according to colour rather than shape (color bias). A human-like bias towards shapes can be induced in the agent, but only if it experiences many more shape terms than colour terms during training. One effect that is considered instrumental in allowing children to overcome the challenges of early word learning is the human shape bias BID21 , whereby infants tend to to presume that novel words refer to the shape of an unfamiliar object rather than, for instance, its colour, size or texture. The fact that the network so readily develops biases that are pertinent to word learning provides insight into established effects of neural networks such as rapid acceleration of word learning (see e.g. BID33 ; BID15 ); it is precisely the progressive specialisation of the agent's object recognition and labelling mechanisms (towards shapes, colours or both, as determined by the training regime) that narrows the space of possible referents, permitting faster word learning as training progresses. To test whether the agent could learn to understand the instruction form pick something that is not an X in a generally applicable way, we periodically measured its ability to interpret negated versions of the instructions in I 2 .As illustrated in Figure 3 , the agent learned to follow both positive and negative instructions, for various sets of instruction words I. However, unlike other linguistic operations such as adjective-noun modification BID15 , the agent exhibited difficulty generalising the notion of negation acquired in the context of I 1 to the held-out items I 2 . This understanding of negation would generalise much worse than an interpretation of 'not w' that involved identifying and avoiding an object of type w. For small training sets, the results suggest that the model prefers the former interpretation, but also that its tendency to discover the latter more generalisable understanding increases as the set of negated concepts to which it is exposed grows. As shown in Figure 4 , an agent that followed the curriculum (i.e. in the second condition) learned notably faster overall than one presented directly with a large group of new words. Word learning speeds The order in which words of different types are acquired has been used to inform theories of child language acquisition BID12 and human semantic processing more generally BID13 . In the standard agent, a distributed representation of the linguistic input is concatenated with the output from the top layer of a 3-layer convolutional visual module at each timestep, fed through a multi-layer perceptron and then passed to the agent's (recurrent) core. An agent trained exclusively on colour words (A) relies more on the first and second layers of the convnet than an agent trained exclusively on shape words (B), which uses second and upper layer visual features. D: A 2D (t-SNE) visualisation of the space of the word embeddings weights in the language module (L) of an agent trained on different word types, illustrating that words cluster naturally according to semantic classes in the linguistic memory of the agent.onto the input image. Figure 6 illustrates the effect of backpropagating the attention probabilities corresponding to each layer of the convnet onto (grayscale copies of) the visual input.8 As is clear from these visualisations, an agent that is exposed only to shape words will learn to rely on features from the upper-most layers of its visual module when considering objects in its surroundings. The ability to control precisely both training and test stimuli in our simulated environment allowed us to isolate this effect as deriving from the training data, and indeed to reach the opposite conclusion about the architecture itself.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

We show that the complete loss function landscape of a neural network can be represented as the quantum state output by a quantum computer. We demonstrate this explicitly for a binary neural network and, further, show how a quantum computer can train the network by manipulating this state using a well-known algorithm known as quantum amplitude amplification. We further show that with minor adaptation, this method can also represent the meta-loss landscape of a number of neural network architectures simultaneously. We search this meta-loss landscape with the same method to simultaneously train and design a binary neural network. Finding a suitable set of weights for a neural network has become one of the most studied problems of modern machine learning. It has presented a significant challenge to computer scientists for whom few successful alternatives to back-propagation are available. It can be difficult to explore very large search spaces efficiently and, worse, optimization may converge to a local minima far from global optimum BID2 . Understanding the cost function landscape is also hard, and choosing hyper-parameters and designing neural networks remains mostly a manual process. As Moore's law approaches its end, two new computing paradigms have been explored, neuromorphic and quantum computers. Quantum computing is based on quantum bits (or qbits) obeying the laws of quantum physics as opposed to the classical bits of today that are based on classical physics. Note that in physics the term classical is used to mean non-quantum and we use this terminology throughout. Quantum machine learning aims to find an advantage in applying quantum computing to machine learning. Current research into quantum machine learning falls into one of two catgeories. Some quantum algorithms promise a revolution in machine learning in theory, but contain many gaps in their implementation in practice. In contrast, others are more realistic in their method, but struggle to justify a place amongst the well-established methods of machine learning. In this paper, it is shown that a quantum computer can output a quantum state that represents the entire cost landscape for a given neural network. The method is shown to be versatile and even able to represent a meta-cost landscape of all possible hyperparameters and parameters. Applying it to the connectivities and weights of a binary neural network and simulating the quantum algorithm on a classical computer, we further show that this landscape state can be used for training and metatraining the binary neural network for a small toy problem using quantum amplitude amplification, a standard quantum algorithm. Binary Neural Networks (BNNs) are neural networks with weights and activations restricted to taking only binary values, usually \\u00b11. The greatest advantage of BNNs is in their deployment as using binary provides great advantages in compression and inference time, as well as computational efficiency through the use of bitwise operations. On the other hand they are relatively tricky to train as the sign function has a derivative of zero nearly everywhere, the search space is discrete, and alternative training methods take significantly longer than non-binarized neural networks. Nonetheless, BNNs have achieved state-of-the-art performance on smaller datasets such as MNIST and CIFAR10 BID4 but initially suffered when applied to larger datasets such as ImageNet. A popular approach to solving this issue has been to relax the binarisation constraints. This has been achieved by using multiple binary activations BID13 or by introducing scale factors BID16 , both of which result in improvements in accuracy. On the other hand, it has been argued that a better training strategy for BNNs is sufficient to achieve high accuracy on large datasets without compromising on the pure binary nature BID22 . After investigating the accuracy failures of the previous methods, a number of improvements to the BNN training process have been suggested such as changing the activation function, lowering the learning rate and using a different regularization term. These changes helped achieve both high accuracy and high compression rates on ImageNet. Again, this solution is not entirely ideal, as training BNNs is already relatively slow, and a lower learning rate exacerbates this issue. Between the efficient deployment, discrete search space, slow training and relatively small problem size (near-term quantum computers favor problems that require fewer bits), training a binary neural network represents an ideal test case for a quantum computer. Finally, BNNs have been suggested as a candidate for efficient hybrid architectures through transfer learning. The idea is that a BNN pretrained on ImageNet may be used as a feature extractor for other datasets by retraining a final non-binarised layer. In this way, a hybrid hardware-software architecture can implement the binary part using efficient hardware and the non-binary final layer in software BID12 . Quantum computers use quantum bits, manipulated with quantum gates in quantum circuits according to quantum algorithms. The advantage of quantum computers over classical computers is that certain quantum algorithms show significantly improved computational complexity compared to the best known classical algorithms. Such improved scaling, combined with the exponentially growing computational power of qubits suggests that (large, error-free) quantum computers would be able to easily handle and process very large amounts of data. Most relevant to this paper is the quantum search algorithm known as Grover's algorithm BID8 , itself a specific case of another algorithm known as quantum amplitude amplification BID0 . These algorithms can search for an element of an unstructured dataset of size N in O( \\u221a N ) operations, over the classical O(N ). It is important to keep in mind that these are compared to the best-known classical algorithms, and not that they are better than all possible classical algorithms. A recent paper BID21 has challenged the presumed superiority of a quantum recommendation algorithm with a new classical algorithm inspired by the quantum method that shows similar scaling. In our case, the optimality of Grover's algorithm has been proven BID24 and so the assumption of its inherent advantage is robust. Some quantum algorithms are able to efficiently perform k-means clustering BID14 and solve linear systems of equations BID9 , among other such achievements (see BID3 for a review). All of these algorithms require the classical data to be encoded into an accessible quantum form of RAM known as a qRAM. Although there is some work on how this might be done BID7 it is not known to even be possible to construct a qRAM in an efficient manner for a completely general dataset. To many, this is a significant drawback that cannot be ignored, and places a heavy burden on the feasibility of these methods. An alternative approach has been to mimic the progress of classical machine learning by using methods classically known to work. Many have taken to using classical computers to train parametrized quantum circuits to perform classification BID19 or to learn generative models BID6 . Some, but not all, of these circuits mimic neural networks in that they are layered and try to utilize non-linearities . The biggest issue with this approach is the lack of an efficient algorithm for training quantum circuits and so current methods are akin to black box optimization. The motivation is that the output of quantum circuits are known to be impossible to efficiently simulate with classical computers and could therefore provide superior performance on that basis. A slightly different approach to training a perceptron using quantum amplitude amplification has been explored before and its complexity studied compared to classical methods BID10 . Previous work has demonstrated and experimentally implemented the use of quantum hardware to perform binary classification, BID15 ) but this is not the same as the method proposed in this paper, as this work is based on a different, more general gate-based form of quantum computation as opposed to the quantum annealing devices of the former. Quantum computing follows the structure of classical computing very closely. Quantum bits, or qubits, are the fundamental unit of quantum information. Their values are manipulated by applying quantum (logic) gates to them in the form of quantum circuits. Qubits are challenging to manufacture in practice due to the noise-sensitive nature of quantum properties. The biggest such device in existence today contains just 72 highly imperfect qubits, but it is worth noting that progress has advanced at a particularly rapid pace over the past few years and a number are available for public access on the cloud. In addition, simulating the behaviour of qubits using classical computers is difficult, requiring exponentially increasing resources as the number of qubits increases -with an upper limit of 50 (perfect) qubits often cited for the most powerful supercomputers. Therefore, quantum algorithms are almost always defined in terms of their circuit implementation, as opposed to the higher level abstraction of classical algorithms. Qubits are the unit of quantum information and are fundamentally different to classical bits. Whilst classical bits are completely described as being in one of two states, either 0 or 1, the state of a qubit cannot be fully described by just a single number. It can be in the 0 state, the 1 state or a quantum superposition of both. Mathematically the state of a qubit is a two dimensional vector with complex elements and a unit norm. We can write a general form for this vector as DISPLAYFORM0 Here \\u03b1 and \\u03b2 are the probability amplitudes of the zero state |0 and the one state |1 respectively. Qubits cannot be simply read out as classical bits are, but are instead measured. Measurement is a unique feature of quantum mechanics. If the qubit given above is measured, it will be found in the zero state with probability |\\u03b1| 2 , outputting a value of 0, and the one state with probability |\\u03b2| 2 outputting a value of 1. Therefore measurement of a qubit state always produces a binary outcome, no matter the actual state itself. Measurement is fundamentally indeterministic, probabilistic and irreversible. Upon measurement, the original state is lost along with the values of \\u03b1 and \\u03b2 as the qubit collapses to the state |0 or |1 corresponding to the measurement outcome. As a result, the values \\u03b1 and \\u03b2 cannot be obtained without repeated measurements of many identical copies of the state. Here \\u03c6 is a phase that does not affect measurement outcome, but can be manipulated with quantum gates and play a role in quantum algorithms. Part of the power of quantum computing is the ability to harness superposition to parallelize certain computations and processes. An important feature of qubits is the way in which they are combined. N qubits are collectively described by a complex vector of unit norm in a similar way as the above, but the length of this vector is given by 2 N . It is this exponential scaling that makes even modest numbers of qubits unfeasible to simulate on a classical computer. In both classical and quantum computing, gates manipulate the states of bits and qubits. As complex vectors, qubit states are transformed into one another by applying complex matrices called operators or simply, quantum gates. This transformation follows the rules of linear algebra and a state |\\u03c8 is transformed into a different state |\\u03c6 by a gate U according to the matrix transformation |\\u03c6 = U |\\u03c8 . In order to maintain the stringent requirement of a unit norm, these matrices are restricted to being unitary. A unitary matrix is defined as any square matrix who's inverse is its complex conjugate transpose. Unitarity implies that every quantum gate is reversible, in a manner similar to reversible computing. This fundamental difference in the kinds of operations that can be performed on qubits compared to classical bits is part of the power of quantum computing, but can make analogies to classical computing difficult. Many quantum operations have no classical analogue and conversely, certain simple classical operations (e.g copying the state of a general qubit) are impossible in quantum computing. Just as in classical computing, small sets of quantum gates are universal in that they can be combined to generate any other. It transpires that a small set of quantum gates are sufficient to our work and we choose to list them here, both in terms of their actions and their matrix forms. The X (NOT) gate flips the state of a qubit from |1 to |0 and vice versa. For qubits in superposition, it swaps the amplitudes of the |1 and |0 states. Its matrix form is DISPLAYFORM0 The Z gate has no classical analogue and takes the matrix form DISPLAYFORM1 It transforms an arbitrary state \\u03b1 |0 + \\u03b2 |1 into the state \\u03b1 |0 \\u2212 \\u03b2 |1 . The probability amplitude of the |1 component has changed sign, but the probabilities associated with measurement outcome, as squares of the probability amplitudes, remain unchanged. Note that this still represents a completely different state. The Hadamard (H) gate also has no classical analogue. It is used to transform qubits from their initial state |0 into the state DISPLAYFORM2 |1 -an equal quantum superposition of 0 and 1. As a matrix it is DISPLAYFORM3 The controlled-not (CNOT) gate can be thought of as a generalisation of the classical XOR gate. It performs a NOT gate on a target qubit if a control qubit is in the state |1 . We write this as DISPLAYFORM4 Note that controlled gates can be extended both to arbitrary gates (e.g. CZ) and to arbitrary numbers of control qubits (e.g. CCCNOT). The main advantage of qubits over classical bits is their ability to be placed and processed in quantum superpositions of states. The key to our method is to use superposition to parallelize the processing of weights in a way not possible classically. Our scheme proceeds as follows: Step 1: The weights are represented in some way by the quantum state of a set of qubits. Setting those qubits into a state that represents an equal superposition of every possible set of weights allows them to define the domain. Step 2: We then build a quantum circuit analogue of the neural network U QN N that takes in a given set of weights (encoded within qubits as above) and an empty register, and outputs onto the register the corresponding accuracy according to the chosen neural network i.e U QN N (w, 0) = (w, acc w ).Step 3: Since U QN N is a quantum circuit, inputting weights in superposition form allows them to be processed in parallel. Thus by using the domain-defining qubits as the weights input to U QN N the output will be a superposition correlating all possible weights to their corresponding accuracies. This is what we refer to as the landscape state. We can write this as DISPLAYFORM0 where W is the set of all possible weights, W is its size and O w the accuracy of the neural network given the set of weights w. This is a single quantum state representing the entire landscape of the neural network by correlating every possible set of weights with its resultant accuracy. In the language of quantum physics the weights and the accuracies are entangled. This method can be adapted in many ways. For example, if just a single weight is set it to superposition and the rest kept to a given value, then the output is the cost landscape of just that one weight conditional on the value of the others. We are not limited to only setting weights in superposition. We note that a meta-neural network with the presence/absence of the connections within the neural network themselves represented by binary parameters can also be created. These meta-parameters can also be encoded in qubits, formed into a quantum circuit and set to superposition. If we set both the weights and the connection meta-parameters to superposition then the output state of the quantum circuit contains an entire meta-cost landscape of every possible weight with every possible connectivity of a neural network simultaneously correlated with the respective accuracy. We demonstrate our method by generating the landscape state for a small binary neural network on simple toy problems and use it to train the network. The advantage of binary neural networks is that each weight can be naturally represented by just one qubit and so are therefore a suitable demonstration given the fundamentally small number of qubits that can be simulated on a nonquantum device. We construct two toy problems, both of which are a binary classification on three binary features x i \\u2208 {\\u22121, 1} of eight data points corresponding to every 2 3 arrangement of those features. In problem 1, the label is given by the function DISPLAYFORM0 and for problem 2 the label is given by DISPLAYFORM1 In both cases we define the sign function as: DISPLAYFORM2 We choose to implement the BNN given in figure 1 meaning that we are aiming to find eight binary weights. To construct a quantum circuit equivalent to the BNN, henceforth known as the Quantum Binary Neural Network (QBNN), every operation in the implementation of a BNN must be mapped to a quantum equivalent. Below we detail each of these and their quantum implementation. Representing numerical values with qubits is already well established in the literature BID20 . Other parts of our construction are, however, incompatible with non-binary input and so we restrict ourselves to the simple case of a binary data input. In this case, the qubit states |1 and |0 represent the values +1, \\u22121 respectively. In a quantum circuit, all qubits begin in the |0 state and need only an application of a single NOT gate to be set to |1 where appropriate. Given two qubits representing binary values \\u00b11 as described above, we can multiply them using an anti-CNOT gate. An anti-CNOT gate applies a NOT gate to a target qubit if the control qubit is in the state |0 instead of |1 . Its truth table is identical to an XNOR gate and outputs |1 if both input values are equal, and |0 otherwise. This truth table matches the truth table of multiplying two binary values and thus performs the same function. It can be constructed using two NOT gates and a CNOT gate. Qubits that encode weights must always be used as control qubits to preserve the values they encode. Since the sign function is highly non-linear, it poses the greatest challenge to translate to the linear algebra-based language of quantum mechanics. Generally, the problem can be overcome by the addition of extra helper or 'ancilla' qubits. If we restrict the problem to the special case of binary arguments only, the sign function 1 is reduced to finding whether there exist N/2 qubits out of N in state |1 . This can be achieved by constructing a quantum analogue of a classical majority function by replacing AND gates with CCNOT gates and constructing OR gates out of CNOT and NOT gates. The number of gates needed scales as the binomial coefficient N choose N/2. As an example, figure 2 shows a three input neuron and its quantum circuit implementation. Note that this is just a single neuron, and not our entire network. In practice, it works in the same manner as a classical neural network. The activations of each neuron in one layer are then weighted by their own weight qubits and used as input to the next layer and so on. This whole circuit is what we refer to as the QBNN. For each data point on the training set we must compare the prediction to the label in order to find the accuracy. We initialise a register of qubits to store the predictions. The reversibility of quantum circuits allows us to apply the QBNN for a given data point, store its output value onto its corresponding qubit on the register, perform the same QBNN in reverse order -its inverse -to refresh the other qubits, and continue for the next data point in the training set. This resetting is a common, necessary workaround for small quantum computers and is easily avoided by parallelization given more qubits. For a training set of size N , we obtain a register of N qubits containing the predictions of the QBNN for each of them. Since both the labels and the outputs are binary, we can represent the accuracy of each of these predictions by performing a NOT gate on all the qubits corresponding to a data point with a label of 0. Each qubit in this register will then be in the state |1 if it corresponds to a correctly classified data point and |0 if it does not. By applying the QBNN over the entire training set with the weights initialized in superposition, our circuit output is the cost landscape state. Training the BNN can be seen as a search for a single state within the cost function landscape, for which we use a quantum algorithm known as quantum amplitude amplification. It is not the first time that quantum amplitude amplification has been suggested as a means to train quantum neural networks BID17 ), but they did not construct the actual details of an implementation such as the method of generating a nonlinearity. Quantum amplitude amplification is a technique to amplify the probability amplitudes that correspond to desired state(s) within the superposition and therefore increase the probability of measuring one of these. It works by splitting the space of all states into a 'good' and a 'bad' subspace and rotating their relative probabilities when measured. In this case the 'good' subspace is defined as that which has all the qubits in the prediction register in the state |1 implying that all data points have been correctly classified. It is known that quantum amplitude amplification requires just O(1/ \\u221a a) to search for an entry with an occurrence probability of a BID0 . Quantum amplitude amplification works by first constructing the amplifying operator, Q. DISPLAYFORM0 The composite operation, Q, is interpreted as a sequence of operations applied from right to left as read in the equation above. U QBN N is our entire QBNN circuit (for all data points), and U \\u22121 QBN N is its (matrix) inverse. Since quantum gates are reversible, and every gate we have used is self-inverse, we obtain this by applying all of the gates of U QBN N in reverse order. The operations S 0 and S \\u03c7 reverse the sign of the probability amplitudes of the initial state and the target state(s) respectively. In this case, our target states correspond to those with an accuracy of 100% and S \\u03c7 is a controlled-Z gate performed on each of the target qubits. Similarly, the initial state of any quantum computer is defined as having all the qubits in the state |0 , and thus we can implement S 0 by first applying a NOT gate to each qubit and then applying the same controlled-Z gates as for S \\u03c7 . FIG2 is a pictorial representation of how quantum amplitude amplification changes the probability distribution of the measured weights. If we write the initial probability of obtaining the correct weights by random as p and the number of successive applications of operator Q to be k, it can be shown that the probability of obtaining the optimal weights when measuring the circuit after k amplifications is sin 2 (2k + 1)\\u03b8where p and \\u03b8 obey the relation p = sin 2 \\u03b8 BID0 . The probability of success is therefore highly periodic in k. The problem of training the BNN essentially reduces to a probabilistic search on this one hyper-parameter and its regular periodic landscape. The location of the first maximum, i.e of k * , is inversely proportional to \\u03b8 and hence to the probability of obtaining the weights by random. In other words, a harder problem with more weights to search requires a greater number of quantum amplifications to find. In practical terms the landscape state is a set of 8 weight qubits and 8 prediction qubits. After the search, at the end of the entire process, all the qubits are measured. If the prediction qubits are all in the state |1 the training was a success and the appropriate weights can be simply read off their corresponding qubits. We constructed and simulated the QBNN and quantum amplitude amplification circuits on the projectQ framework BID18 . The use of an actual quantum computer was not possible as the number of gates used during the computation (called circuit depth) exceeds the maximum possible circuit depth for the current generation of imperfect noisy qubits. Furthermore, we use more qubits than are available on current publicly accessible quantum hardware. For each of the two problems defined, we plotted the probability of obtaining an optimal set of weights against the number of iterations of the quantum amplitude amplification and obtained results, shown in FIG3 , that match well with the expected periodic behavior described in equation 3. This confirms that a quantum search of the landscape state can indeed be used to train a BNN in exactly the manner as predicted theoretically. We emphasize here that every reference to finding optimal weights means that the BNN has been trained to an accuracy of 100% on the training data. In order to demonstrate the performance of this method in actual training, we follow the simple algorithm described in BID0 for probing this landscape. This simple algorithm begins with n = 0 and chooses a random integer k of quantum amplifications between 0 and n. n increases by 1 until the training succeeds. In our experiment, we perform 100 runs of this algorithm and present in figure 5 a cumulative plot of the proportion of these runs that were successful against the number of iterations this algorithm required. We find that training succeeds with a probability over 90% after just 5 steps for the first problem and 6 steps for the second. In order to compare this to a classical search, we search the entire space of 2 8 = 256 possible sets of weights and find that there are eight and four correct sets of weights (giving 100% accuracy) for the first and second problem respectively. Statistically, if these weights were to be searched through the analogous classical brute data is the cumulative probability of success over 100 runs of the algorithm. Classical results are analytically derived from the known probability of obtaining a solution by random search. The superior scaling of the quantum algorithm becomes more prominent for harder problems.force search, one would find that it requires 28 and 57 steps respectively to succeed with a confidence over 90%. This matches our expectation of a quadratic speedup of the quantum search over the classical. We then construct a more complex QBNN which can incorporate meta-training by introducing a set of binary indicators that correspond to the presence or absence of a set of connections within the BNN and encode these within qubits in the exact same way as was done with the weights. With the weights and connection parameters both set to superpositions, the output of this circuit is the meta-cost landscape, where weights, connections and accuracy are all entangled with one another. As before quantum amplitude amplification is used to search for the state with all points correctly classified. Again this has been suggested before, but we present a full circuit implementation of this idea (da BID5 . In practice, due to qubit number constraints, we choose to only learn the structure of the first layer of the BNN. The second layer remains fixed. Due to the increased size of the circuit, and the significant increase in computational cost, we did not perform a complete classical search of the space as before but it is clear to see that the space of parameters we are searching has increased and therefore the number of amplifications required has similarly increased. Between 16 and 20 amplifications were found to be sufficient to produce results with a reasonable probability. FIG5 (a) shows the meta-BNN that was used, and (b) and (c) show two solutions to problems 1 and 2 respectively learnt by our meta-QBNN. It is particularly interesting to note that the learned structures of the two BNN solutions seem to match well with their problem definitions (equation 1 and equation 2). Note that due to our circuit construction a neuron that receives no input will always output \\u22121. We show that quantum superposition can be used to represent many parameters of a neural network at once and efficiently encode entire loss landscapes in a quantum state using just a single run of a quantum circuit. We demonstrate this explicitly for both parameters and hyper-parameters of a BNN, and show that further processing of this state can lead to quantum advantage in training and metatraining. As a training method it possesses significant advantages as it is landscape-independent, has a quadratic speedup over a classical search of the same kind, and would be able to solve statistically neutral problems such as parity problems BID23 . It is not, however, without shortcomings. One potential criticism is the issue of over-fitting. Since our problem is so small, we chose to define a target state as one where the accuracy is 100% on the training set but this is rarely desirable in real machine learning. One solution may be to simply run the quantum algorithm and, upon finding a particular set of weights that represents an overfit, run the algorithm again but with a deselection of that particular set of weights. This can be done by simply changing the sign of the probability amplitude corresponding to that state during each iteration of the quantum amplitude amplification. A similar issue is that regular machine learning typically uses batch learning, whilst our method incorporates the entire dataset at once. This too can be fixed by altering our method to use a different batch of the data for each quantum amplitude amplification iteration. This works since no matter what batch we use, a good set of weights should still be amplified by the circuit. In fact, such an implementation is advantageous since it would allow us to use less qubits which in practical terms are limited in number in the near term. A significant limitation in our method is the requirement that the input is binary, and the poor scaling of the activation function. Both of these problems arise completely from our implementation of the sign function, which could either be improved or replaced entirely with a different binary activation function that could be implemented more efficiently on a quantum computer and would be compatible with non-binary input. There has been progress on creating effective non-linear activation functions by so-called repeat-until-success circuits BID1 ). An alternative approach would be to use floating point representations as in classical computing and the quantum equivalent of full-adders, but this would require an overhead in the number of qubits that would take us beyond the limit of classical simulation. Finally, we note that this method scales poorly compared to backpropagation and that the advantage only appears in like for like comparisons of unstructured classical/quantum searches. The cost function landscape is not unstructured and algorithms such as backpropagation take advantage of this. We conjecture that a quantum search method that applies quantum advantage to structured searches, if it exists, can be applied to the cost landscape in place of quantum amplitude amplification. Finding ways to harness quantum computers to aid classical machine learning methods in a meaningful way remains an open problem and we present the loss landscape state as a plausible candidate towards this goal. Whilst we used the example of quantum training, the most fruitful approach in the short term is to ask whether some property of the state can be used to glean useful information for classical machine learning methods. This might take the form of understanding the roughness of the landscape, identifying certain features, or even choosing an appropriate learning rate. Further work in investigating the relationship between the landscape as a quantum state and its features from a machine learning perspective would be a step forward in this direction.\",\n          \"Dialogue research tends to distinguish between chit-chat and goal-oriented tasks. While the former is arguably more naturalistic and has a wider use of language, the latter has clearer metrics and a more straightforward learning signal. Humans effortlessly combine the two, and engage in chit-chat for example with the goal of exchanging information or eliciting a specific response. Here, we bridge the divide between these two domains in the setting of a rich multi-player text-based fantasy environment where agents and humans engage in both actions and dialogue. Specifically, we train a goal-oriented model with reinforcement learning via self-play against an imitation-learned chit-chat model with two new approaches: the policy either learns to pick a topic or learns to pick an utterance given the top-k utterances. We show that both models outperform a strong inverse model baseline and can converse naturally with their dialogue partner in order to achieve goals. In the literature on artificial dialogue agents, a distinction is often made between \\\"goal-oriented\\\" dialogue, where an agent is tasked with filling slots or otherwise obtaining or disseminating specified information from the user to help complete a task, and \\\"chit-chat\\\", where an agent should imitate human small talk. Modeling goal-oriented dialogue can have advantages over chit-chat imitation as it gives clearer metrics of success and perhaps more meaningful learning signals; but goal-oriented dialogue data is often more specialized, covering only a narrow slice of natural language. Current goal-oriented datasets study setting like booking restaurants or airline tickets, or obtaining weather information, as standalone tasks (Raux et al., 2005; Henderson et al., 2014; Bordes et al., 2017; El Asri et al., 2017; Budzianowski et al., 2018) . Chit-chat agents, by contrast, might focus on coarse statistical regularities of dialogue data without accurately modeling the underlying \\\"meaning\\\"; but the data often covers a much wider space of natural language. For example, Twitter or Reddit chitchat tasks (Li et al., 2016a; Yang et al., 2018; Mazar\\u00e9 et al., 2018 ) cover a huge spectrum of language and diverse topics. Chit-chat and goal-oriented dialogue are not mutually exclusive: when humans engage in chit-chat, their aim is to exchange information, or to elicit specific responses from their partners. Modeling such goals, however, is made difficult by the fact that it requires large amounts of world knowledge, and that goals in real life are implicit. In this work, we study goal-oriented dialogue agents in the setting of a multi-player text-based fantasy environment (Urbanek et al., 2019) . The environment is built on top of a game engine that grounds actions and reference objects, and thus codifies a body of world-knowledge. Although the interactions between objects and characters are simulated, the choice and types of interactions, the text used to describe them, and the dialogues between characters, are \\\"natural\\\" and wide-ranging, having been collected from human crowdworkers. We define the general task of, given a particular character in a particular scenario (location, set of objects and other characters to interact with) to conduct open-ended dialogue such that a given action is executed in the future by their dialogue partner. The given action could be an emote action (smile, laugh, ponder, . . . ), or a game action (wear chain mail, drink mead, put glass on table, . . . ). The richness of the environment means that there are a huge set of possible tasks and scenarios in which to achieve a wide range of actions. Thus, this task is ideally suited for bridging the divide between goal-oriented and chit-chat dialogue, combining clearer metrics and learning signals on the one hand, with the richness and complexity of situated but open-domain natural language on the other. Figure 1 : Example episode from the LIGHT dataset, consisting of an environment (location setting, characters with given personas, objects), utterances and game actions. There are 10,777 such humanhuman gameplay episodes, and a rich world of 663 locations, 1755 characters and 3462 objects. We train models to achieve these tasks using reinforcement learning (RL) and a type of self-play between two agents. The first agent, which we call the environment agent, is trained with imitation learning on human-human interactions (game actions, utterances and emotes) and subsequently kept fixed. The second agent, the RL agent, is trained to conduct dialogue given the goal, and the two agents interact within a given environment until the goal is either reached or a given number of turns has expired. At that point, rewards are given, and the RL agent is updated. We compare agents that have been trained to imitate human actions given a goal (an \\\"inverse model\\\") to two different RL approaches: optimizing actions with latent discrete variables (topics), or via rewarding actions sampled from the model (via the top-K outputs). We show that both types of RL agent are able to learn effectively, outperforming the inverse model approach or a vanilla chit-chat imitation baseline, and can converse naturally with their dialogue partner to achieve goals. We work in the LIGHT game environment (Urbanek et al., 2019) , which is a multi-user text-based game, involving many characters playing the game at once. Characters (either played by humans or run by models) can speak to to each other via free text, send emote actions like applaud, nod or pout (22 emote types in total), and take actions to move to different locations and interact with objects (e.g. get cutlery, put cutlery in drawer, etc.), see Appendix A for a full list of game actions. LIGHT at its core has a game engine which can formally be defined as a graph, where each location, object and character is a node, and they are connected by labeled edges representing relationships, for example contained-in, path-to or has-property. Actions in the game result in changes in state of the graph. To a player (agent) a local view of the graph can be seen and this is expressed in text, as are the game actions and changes of state. This text then naturally interleaves with the dialogue utterances of the speakers as well to form a input context sequence from which a character can base their subsequent actions. See Fig. 1 for an example. To make the world and its textual descriptions, LIGHT consists of a large set of human-written game locations, characters, and objects, all based within a fantasy medieval setting. Their names, descriptions and properties were crowd-sourced, yielding a total of 663 locations, 1755 characters, and 3462 objects. They range from beaches with crabs and seaweed to crypts with archaeologists and coffins, yielding an extremely rich environment for agents to learn within. An additional set of crowdworkers were then asked to play the role of characters (randomly picked from the set of 1755) within the created world as rendered by the game engine. This involved them making utterances, game actions and emotes, while interacting with each other (in pairs). The resulting gameplay data consists of 10,777 episodes with an average of 18.3 actions each (game actions, emotes and utterances) of rich human play. These are split into train (8538), validation (500) and test (1739) portions, the latter being split into new episodes in existing settings (test seen, 1000) and completely new settings (test unseen, 739) . This gameplay data can be used for training models using imitation learning, as well as for obtaining \\\"common sense\\\" knowledge about how the world works, i.e., what kinds of things certain characters say; what actions they use with certain objects; what they say and how they act in certain environments or while interacting with certain other characters. The whole environment is thus intended as a proxy for learning about the world within a rich simulation, while avoiding the complexities and bandwidth of rendering (3D) computer graphics. While players were not given specific goals, but instead asked to play the role convincingly of the character given, during play some of them effectively defined their own goals during the interactions, see Fig. 1 . The tasks we consider in this work involve interaction between two agents in a given LIGHT scenario. One of the agents, which we will call M env , together with the game engine, effectively functions as an environment for the other agent, which we will call M RL . Because we will formulate our tasks as a reinforcement learning problem, we will also refer to M env as the \\\"environment agent\\\" and M RL as the \\\"RL agent\\\". We assume that the environment agent is fixed; in this work it will be a model trained via behavioral cloning from human-human interaction data. The RL agent must conduct open-ended dialogue such that a given goal action is executed in the future by the environment agent. Our task is formally defined as follows. The two agents M env and M RL are given their views of the scenario (D env and D RL respectively). These consist of the setting name, scenario description, character names, and their own persona, all described as a sequence of text (see Fig 2) . Note that each agent can only access their own persona but not the persona of the partner with whom they are conversing, but they do know the name of their partner. Denote by t the time-step of the environment, U RL t and U env t the utterances of the agents M RL and M env respectively, and denote by A env t the environment actions by M env . Hence the interaction sequence looks like Note that there is an inversion from the usual reinforcement literature language, as the \\\"actions\\\" of the RL agent are its utterances U RL t ; the actions A env t of the environment agent should be considered as internal mechanics of the environment. The agent M RL is additionally given a goal g to achieve, which consists of an action which must be executed by the other agent. That is, the objective of M RL is for M env to take the action g. An episode ends when A env t == g or when n becomes larger than a set number of turns. The RL agent only speaks, but does not perform game or emote actions. This was chosen for simplicity, but also to guarantee that the RL agent cannot help force the goal to be reached by performing actions itself -it has to pick the appropriate utterances U RL such that M env eventually takes the action g. Goals We experiment separately with two different types of goals: game actions and emote actions. We use the same train, valid, test (seen and unseen) split of the original human-human LIGHT episodes, assign roles M RL and M env randomly, and randomly pick an action by M env that occurs in the episode as the goal. We can then present the corresponding setting to our agents in order to form a new interaction, but within the same scenario and with a goal that was naturally desirable and achievable within that setting. Observations The state observation O t = (D RL , S t\\u22121 , g) at time t given to an RL model consists of the RL agent's setting description (D RL ), the utterance and action history up to that time step (S t\\u22121 ), and the agent's goal (g). Our RL agent models consume O t as a flattened sequence of tokens, and return a dialogue utterance U RL t . Each structured component is represented in the flattened sequenced separated by a special token denoting the types, e.g. names, settings, etc., see Fig. 2 . Note that because the entire history and goal is given to the RL agent, the environment is Markovian. Reward We have a terminal reward of +1 only if the goal g is achieved and 0 otherwise, i.e, it is +1 if the environment agent takes the goal action g. The episode ends after n steps. In our experiments we consider n = 1 and n = 3. In this section we describe the models for M env and M RL . In this work these are retrieval models, using the LIGHT dialogue corpus as candidates. We leave generative models to future work. Base Agent Architecture For all our models we adopt the same base architecture, which is a 12-layer bidirectional transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) pre-trained on a large dialogue corpus (Reddit, 174M examples), and then fine-tuned on our task 1 . To score retrieval candidates, we use a biencoder as in Urbanek et al., 2019) . That is, two transformers are used, one to encode the context, and another to encoder a candidate dialogue, and a dot product between the first output vector of each scores the match. To produce a dialogue utterance one then takes the utterance with the largest output from the training set candidates (111k in this case). For emotes and actions, the same procedure is used, but with those candidate sets instead. For actions, the candidates are the set of admissible actions at that game state, which are provided by the game engine, for example get apple is only available in the candidate set if it is a valid action (an apple is present in the room). For emotes, all 22 candidates are always available. To train the model, a cross entropy loss is used. Similar to Mazar\\u00e9 et al. (2018) , during training we consider the other elements of the batch as negatives. Environment agent The environment agent is the base agent described above, and stays fixed during episodes where the RL agent is trained. This helps guarantee that our RL models stick to using the semantics of natural language (English) rather than so-called language drift, of learning a new emergent language with the same tokens (Lee et al., 2019) . RL agents We design two RL approaches for our tasks -learn to pick the right latent discrete variables (topics) that lead to the correct U RL i ; and learn to pick the correct U RL i from the top K candidates. These are described in more detail in Sections 4.2 and 4.3. We also discuss a baseline \\\"inverse\\\" model trained via behavioral cloning on the human-human data. We consider an inverse model, trained to imitate human actions given a goal, as both a baseline for comparing to RL models, and for producing weights form which we can fine-tune. The inverse model consists of a Bi-encoder, as described above, which takes as input an observation O t similar to our RL models, and outputs an utterance. We train it by extracting from the human-human game logs training set (which does not have goals) every instance where a game action occurs at time t in S t , that is where for 0 < i < t might be null). We then construct a training example for the inverse model with observation (D RL , g = A env t , S t\\u22121 ). i.e. setting the goal g to be A env t , and with the desired action to be taken by the agent as U RL t . Here we use the subscripts \\\"RL\\\" and \\\"env\\\" just to mark the relative positions in the sequence, as all actions and utterances come from the human logs. Note also that unlike the RL agents we train, the human in the RL agent \\\"position\\\" can take game actions. We can thus train this model in a supervised manner using a cross entropy loss as described before. This model does not learn a policy interactively, and hence might not learn to plan or strategize optimally for goal completion. The data distribution it is trained on is different than the data distribution seen by the RL agents. Nevertheless, it can serve as a strong baseline. Further, when training our RL agents, we initialize their weights to the weights of this model, and then fine-tune from that point. Optimizing all the parameters of a large transformer architecture by RL is both incredibly costly in data efficiency and computing time, and is also known to have the problem of language drift (Lee et al., 2019) -that is, there is no guarantee after training with self-chat that the models will output recognizable natural language utterances. A solution to both problems is to train most of the parameters of the model with human-human language data, and then to either disentangle or only optimize some of the parameters with model self-chat . Here, we propose a straight-forward model for that purpose. We assume an RL agent that consists of two components. The first component F c (O) = P (T c (O)) maps from an observation to a discrete variable with C possible values. It consists of a chain of two functions: a transformer T s that takes in the observation, and outputs a state representations, and a policy chooser c = P (s) \\u2208 (1, . . . , C) which takes in the state representation and outputs the value of the discrete latent variable. The second component T u (O, c) is an additional transformer that takes as input the observation as well as the output of the first component, and outputs a dialogue utterance. That is, the entire model is the chain u = T u (O, P (T s (O))). We make this explicit decomposition so that we can train only part of the model with RL; note that the \\\"action\\\" trained via RL is choosing c, not outputting the final utterance. Initial topics We first pre-train the transformer T s using the inverse model described in Section 4.1, which produces a vectorial representation of a given observation. We then run K-means over the vectorial representations of all observations from the training set to provide the mapping to one of C values, which represent dialogue topics, which we use as our initial function P (s). These two functions together give us our initialization of F c . Table 1 shows the cluster ID and the topic denoted by that cluster along with the most representative sentences (closest to the center) for that cluster for 50 topics. As we can see, the clusters learnt can be coherent about a topic. We use these 50 topics as a set of actions A for our RL setup. From c to A Given our initial choice of F c , we can also pre-train T u . We simply take our initial human-human training data, and for each observation append the topic computed by F c to it. This allows our model to be able to generate an action (utterance) conditional on both an input and a topic. We can now train a policy by RL that optimizes the topic at any given point in the episode. We keep the pre-trained portions of the model T u and T s fixed and during fine-tuning only optimize P . The cluster chooser P is redefined (from the initial K-means) to be an MLP network consisting of 2 layers. A discrete action is sampled from a categorical probability distribution over the possible topics, given by c t \\u223c Categorical(h 2 t ), where h 2 t = tanh(W 2 tanh(W 1 s t + b 1 ) + b 2 ). The state vector s t also encodes the goal g and hence, the policy is conditioned on the goal g of the agent. Hence, the policy can learn strategies that will result in picking actions at each time step t that will help the agent to achieve its goal g. As our RL agent can only choose topics, it cannnot redefine easily the meaning of words to cause language drift. The Top-K model is another approach to keeping the number of trainable parameters small. It uses the inverse model to get a context embedding v context from the observation, and a list of K candidate utterance embeddings v 1 , ...v K . These are the encodings by the inverse model of the K utterances it considers most likely given the context and goal. We then train a small (2-layer) transformer model that takes as input the set {v context , v 1 , ...v K }. We use the attention above weights of v context against the candidates at the last layer of the transformer as the distribution over the candidates for sampling an utterance. We use K = 50 in the experiments. We use the Advantage Actor-Critic implementation (A2C; Kostrikov, 2018) to train the policy and the value function for both the latent-variable and top-K models. Chit-chat dialogue There is an increasing body of work in the domain of chit-chat, where the primary approaches being currently tried are end-to-end neural approaches. They are typically large pre-trained and then fine-tuned transformers, either generative or retrieval, where currently retrieval models work best on a number of tasks (Zhang et al., 2018; Li et al., 2019) . Our work shares a commonality with these approaches in that the original LIGHT dialogue data we use has no specified goals, and humans chit-chat together (and act). Thus, the conversations cover a rich number of diverse topics. In Urbanek et al. (2019) models were trained in a similar fashion to chit-chat task models, and we adopt similar architectures here, but instead adapt them to learn to pursue goals. Goal-oriented dialogue Traditional goal-oriented dialogue has focused on narrow tasks that would typically be useful for a dialogue-based assistant, for example restaurant (Henderson et al., 2014) , taxi, train, and hotel (Budzianowski et al., 2018) or trip (El Asri et al., 2017) booking. Hence, each task typically focuses on a narrow slice of natural language and world knowledge for a specialized domain. Earlier work focused on labeled state representations, slot filling mechanisms and dialogue managers (Rieser & Lemon, 2011) , and more recent work has shifted to an end-to-end approach (Bordes et al., 2017) , in line with chit-chat models, but still the two sets of tasks are rarely considered together, or by using the same methods. RL for dialogue The classical goal-oriented dialogue literature studies RL extensively (Singh et al., 2000) . Typically, they used RL to improve dialogue managers, which manage transitions between dialogue states (Singh et al., 2002; Pietquin et al., 2011; Rieser & Lemon, 2011; Gasic et al., 2013; Fatemi et al., 2016) . Recent works have focused more on end-to-end learning. Some works have focused on self-play type mechanisms for end-to-end reinforcement learning, where the reward is derived from goal. A related approach to ours is the negotation tasks of ; , which require two agents to swap 3 item types (hats, balls, books) where the value of the items is different for the two agents, and derives their personal reward. In contrast, our setup encompasses a rich world of settings and characters -with 3462 object types, and a corresponding large number of actions. This is reflected in the vocabulary size itself (\\u223c32,000 versus \\u223c2,000 in the negotation tasks). Other notable uses of RL in dialogue include within visual question answering (Das et al., 2017) , in the domain of chit-chat where RL has been used to decrease repetitive and generic responses through the the use of self-play (Li et al., 2016b) , and through human-bot conversation (Sankar & Ravi, 2019) . RL for language and games RL is used extensively for learning to play games, one of the most well known examples being AlphaGo (Silver et al., 2016) . Since then, language in games has started to be more deeply explored, for example in graphical games such as Minecraft (Oh et al., 2017) , Real-time strategy war games (Hu et al., 2019) , or in text adventure games (Narasimhan et al., 2015; C\\u00f4t\\u00e9 et al., 2018) . The latter are related to our setting. However, those approaches use RL to optimize the set of actions given feedback in a single-player rather than multi-player game, so the text only refers to the environment, and there is no dialogue or actions from other agents. Our work focuses specifically on the latter. We compare our various models on the game action and emote action tasks. We experiment with differing number of steps n allowed to complete the goal, n = 1 and n = 3. Our main results for both seen and unseen test environments are given in Table 2 . We report the average reward and for n = 3 the average number of turns before completion. The results show clear improvements for our topic RL ( \\u00a74.2) and top-K RL ( \\u00a74.3) compared to the inverse model baseline for all values of n, and both types of actions (game actions and emotes). We show the training curves for topic RL in Fig. 3 , reporting rewards averaged over the batch (512 for n = 1, and 128 for n = 3). They show relatively smooth improvements over time, with clear gains over the baseline. As a sanity check we also tried, after training, to replace the topic RL policy with random topic prediction, which yielded poor results, e.g. 0.217 reward for n = 1 test seen game actions. Our model is clearly learning appropriate topic acts. We show examples of successful utterances, achieving goal actions in Fig. 3 for a diverse range of scenarios, actions and language. (n = 1) (n = 3) (n = 1) (n = 3) In this paper, we investigate agents that can interact (speak or act) and can achieve goals in a rich world with diverse language, bridging the gap between chit-chat and goal-oriented dialogue. We achieve this by defining a task for an agent, where the goal is for the other player to execute a particular action. We explore two reinforcement learning based approaches to solve this task: the policy either learns to pick a topic or learns to pick an utterance given the top K utterances, and compare them against a strong baseline trained to imitate chit-chat. We show that these approaches effectively learn dialogue strategies that lead to successful completion of goals, while producing natural chat. Future work should explore further RL algorithms for agents that can act and speak in natural language at scale in our proposed rich task environment, and we expect further advancements.

In this paper, we bridge adversarial robustness of neural nets with Lyapunov stability of dynamical systems. From this viewpoint, training neural nets is equivalent to finding an optimal control of the discrete dynamical system, which allows one to utilize methods of successive approximations, an optimal control algorithm based on Pontryagin's maximum principle, to train neural nets. This decoupled training method allows us to add constraints to the optimization, which makes the deep model more robust. The constrained optimization problem can be formulated as a semi-definite programming problem and hence can be solved efficiently. Experiments show that our method effectively improves deep model's adversarial robustness. Deep neural networks achieve state-of-the-art performances on a variety of tasks (LeCun et al., 2015) . However, neural nets are known to be vulnerable to adversarial examples. Imperceptibly perturbed inputs can induce erroneous outputs in neural nets (Szegedy et al., 2013) . In image classification problems of computer vision, previous work has proposed various methods to attack deep models and induce low accuracy (Goodfellow et al., 2015; Madry et al., 2017; Papernot et al., 2016a; Carlini & Wagner, 2017a) . Whereas multiple defenses against adversarial attacks are developed, they don't ensure safety faced with strong attacking methods. There are also theories that explain the existence of adversarial examples (Ilyas et al., 2019; Shamir et al., 2019) , but they often fail to fully explain the features and behaviors of this phenomenon. This makes the study of adversarial attacks important in that it is a threat to real-life machine learning systems (Kurakin et al., 2016) . In this paper, we propose a dynamical system view on the adversarial robustness of the models, as well as new method that significantly defense adversarial attacks. Recent works have shown the connection between deep neural networks and dynamical systems (E, 2017; Haber & Ruthotto, 2017; Lu et al., 2017) . If we regard the neural net as a discretization of an ordinary differential equation (ODE), then training neural nets becomes finding an optimal control of the corresponding discrete dynamical system. Traditionally, we often treat training neural networks as an unconstrained non-convex optimization problem where \\u03b8 denotes the parameters of the model, J denotes the loss function and R denotes the regularizer term, and we solve the problem with (stochastic) gradient-descent based methods (Bottou, 2010; Ruder, 2016) . In the training process, we feed the network with a batch of training data, and compute the gradient with forward and backward propagation (E. Rumelhart et al., 1986) . The propagation process resembles solving optimal control problems that tune the parameters to make the output be close to target states. This viewpoint motivates us to bridge adversarial robustness with Lyapunov stability of a dynamical system, and to train robust networks with algorithms that find stable optimal control. We will formulate the discussion in later sections. 2 RELATED WORK 2.1 ADVERSARIAL DEFENSE Many defense methods have been proposed to improve the models' adversarial robustness. The defenses mainly fall into three types: adversarial training (Szegedy et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2019) , modifying the networks (Gu & Rigazio, 2015; Lyu et al., 2015; Papernot et al., 2016b; Nayebi & Ganguli, 2017; Ross & Doshi-Velez, 2017) , and adding external models (Lee et al., 2017; Akhtar et al., 2017; Gebhart & Schrater, 2017; Xu et al., 2018; Sun et al., 2019) . Although various defense methods have been developed, a defended deep model is often successfully attacked by newly developed attacks or specific counter-counter measures (Carlini & Wagner, 2017b) . Therefore, it can be hoped that defenses against general attacks will be devised to make deep learning models (adversarially) robust to real-life threats. Recent works have bridged deep neural networks with ODEs and dynamical systems. On the one hand, deep residual networks (He et al., 2015) can be illustrated as forward Euler scheme approximating an ODE (E, 2017), which motivates us to design effective network structures (Lu et al., 2017) . On the other hand, regarding the network as a dynamical system allows us to set up an optimal control viewpoint of neural nets. Pontryagin's Maximum Principle (Boltyanskii et al., 1960) has been applied to train neural nets Li & Hao, 2018) . Given a T -layer neural net, we let the dynamical system {f t (x t , \\u03b8 t ) : t = 0, . . . , T } represents the network, where x t is the input of t-th layer, \\u03b8 t is the parameter, and f t : denotes the t-th layer's transformation, which is usually a non-linear function \\u03c3(\\u03b8 t x t + b t ) for fully-connected layers, convolution layers and batch normalization layers, etc. Therefore, training the neural net can be regarded as controlling the parameters to let the dynamics fit the training data. Specifically, the training optimization problem can be formulated as a typical optimal control problem as follows: . . , T \\u2212 1, where we use x i to denote the i-th input in the batch and B denote the batch size. J and L are the loss function and the regularizer, respectively. Specially, if the model is a deep residual network with structure x t+1 = x t + f t (x t , \\u03b8 t ), we can regard the problem as the forward Euler discretization of the following continuous optimal control problem: where x(t) is a continuous trajectory from the input to the output logits. Adversarial examples are usually clean images added by a small calculated perturbation \\u03b7. The model predicts correct labels fed with clean inputs x 0 , while the output is completely different when it is fed with perturbed input x 0 + \\u03b7. The dynamical system view of neural nets motivate us to characterize this sensitivity with Lyapunov stability of a system (Hirsch et al., 2004) . Definition 1 (Lyapunov Stability). For a given dynamical system\\u1e8b = f (x), x(0) = x 0 , x e is an equilibrium, then \\u2022 The system is asymptotically stable if it is Lyapunov stable and \\u2203 \\u03b4 > 0 such that if x(0) \\u2212 x e < \\u03b4, then lim t\\u2192\\u221e x(t) \\u2212 x e = 0. \\u2022 The system is exponentially stable if it is asymptotically stable and \\u2203 \\u03b1 > 0, \\u03b2 > 0, \\u03b4 > 0 such that if x(0) \\u2212 x e < \\u03b4, then x(t) \\u2212 x e \\u2264 \\u03b1 x(0) \\u2212 x e e \\u2212\\u03b2t , for all t \\u2265 0. The definitions can be easily extended to discrete-time systems. Intuitively, the Lyapunov stability states that for any small perturbation \\u03b7, the trajectory is still \\\"close enough\\\" to the original one. If we regard a neural net as a dynamical system, and ensure the network is Lyapunov stable, then the model is robust to all (adversarial) perturbations. Due to the connection between numerical ODEs and residual networks, we first consider robustness (i.e. Lyapunov stability) of continuous ODEs. , where \\u03c3 is the activation function, e.g., Sigmoid function or ReLU function, it is stable if Re(\\u03bb i (A)) \\u2264 0, \\u2200i, where Re denotes the real part, and \\u03bb i denotes the i-th eigenvalue. One can see, e.g. Hirsch et al. (2004) , for the proof of this theorem. Theorem 1 provides a set of conditions for stable ODEs. However, deep residual network is only a forward Euler discretization scheme of continuous ODE. To ensure numerical stability, we require |1 \\u2212 \\u03bb i (A)h| \\u2264 1 (Ascher & Petzold, 1998) , where the step size h = 1 in residual networks. Added by the identity mapping in residual networks, we can get the stable conditions for discrete dynamics. Theorem 2 (Stable Discrete Networks). For a discrete neural network, i.e., discrete dynamics {f t (x t , \\u03b8 t ) : t = 0, . . . , T }, where f t (x t , \\u03b8 t ) = \\u03c3(\\u03b8 t x t ) (we omit the bias term for simplicity), the network is stable if the \\u03c1(\\u03b8 t ) \\u2264 1, where \\u03c1(A) = max i (|\\u03bb i (A)|) is the spectral radius. If the conditions are added to the unconstrained optimization problem of training, we can greatly improve the adversarial robustness of neural nets. The methods will be discussed in the following section. 4.1 PMP AND MSA For deterministic systems, the Pontryagin's Maximum Principle (PMP) (Boltyanskii et al., 1960) provides a set of necessary conditions for optimal control of the system. Various algorithms have been proposed to solve the deterministic optimal control problem based on PMP. Among them, the Method of Successive Approximations (MSA) (Krylov & Chernous'ko, 1963 ) is one of the simplest algorithms. In the field of deep learning, previous work has utilized MSA to train neural networks Li & Hao, 2018) . Formally, consider the optimal control problem for training neural nets in section 3. For dynamics {f t (x t , \\u03b8 t ) : t = 0, . . . , T }, assume \\u03b8 * = \\u03b8 * 0 , . . . , \\u03b8 * T \\u22121 is a solution to the optimal control problem. Also, we define the Hamiltonian function H : , where the dot denotes the inner product. We have the following necessary conditions for \\u03b8 * . Theorem 3 (Pontryagin's Maximum Principle for Discrete Systems). Assume f t and J are sufficiently smooth. There exists co-states p * = {p * 0 , . . . , p * T } s.t. the following conditions hold: For simplicity of notations, here we assume the batch size is 1. One can easily extend the theorem to minibatch training case by summing over the batch. The theorem can be proved by KKT conditions (Boyd & Vandenberghe, 2004) , where the co-states can be seen as the Lagrangian dual variables. Consider the conditions in PMP, one can find the x equations are exactly the forward propagation of a neural net, and the p equations resemble the backward propagation process. The third condition states that the model parameters must maximize the Hamiltonian function. This motivates us to iteratively compute forward and backward propagation, and solve the Hamiltonian maximization to find the optimal control, which is exactly the Method of Successive Approximations (Algorithm 1). In practice, we usually add regularizer terms that penalize great changes in the maximization step to prevent drastic steps that cause divergence. For the connection between MSA and back-propagationbased gradient descent algorithms, see the appendix of Li & Hao (2018) . Compute the states (forward propagation): The advantages of training by MSA compared with gradient descent algorithms has been discussed in , among which the most significant feature is that the optimization steps on different layers are decoupled. Concretely, after computing the states x and co-states p, the optimization step on layer t is only searching for parameters \\u03b8 t . This not only suggests that the optimization process can be accelerated by parallelization, but also allows us to utilize the features of the problem. The parameter space is greatly reduced compared with the original intractable optimization problem, and hence the optimization is much more easier. This allows us to add constraints that ensure robustness of the model. Consider a layer in the form of f t (x) = \\u03b8 t x, where we leave the activation as an individual layer with no parameters for simplicity, we can derive the following optimization problem for Hamiltonian maximization: max where \\u03b1 \\u03b8 t 2 2 is the L 2 norm regularizer (weight decay), and \\u03b8 t is the initial parameter (i.e., \\u03b8 k t in the algorithm). The last term keeps the training process from drastic steps that cause divergence. The constraint, as illustrated in section 3, is the stable condition for discrete systems. It makes the optimization quite difficult if we directly add the constraints in gradient descent based algorithms, but the decoupled optimization in MSA allows us to do so. With regard to the constraint of parameter's spectral radius, a simple method is to apply special forms of matrices for parameters, e.g. anti-symmetric matrices. For continuous deep models, the only constraint is Theorem 1, i.e., Re(\\u03bb i (\\u03b8 t )) \\u2264 0. Anti-symmetric matrices have only imaginary eigenvalues, and hence we can replace \\u03b8 t with \\u03b8 t \\u2212 \\u03b8 (Goodfellow et al., 2015) 2.34% 77.45% 49.32% PGD-10 (Madry et al., 2017) 0.02% 46.67% 36.33% C&W (Carlini & Wagner, 2017a) Proof. Recall that \\u03c1(A) \\u2264 A 2 = \\u03bb max (A T A), we have Hence we can replace \\u03c1(\\u03b8 t ) \\u2264 1 with a positive semi-definite condition, and we turn the Hamiltonian maximization into a new optimization problem, where the target function is quadratic and the constraint is a semi-definite condition. This can be reduced to a semi-definite programming (SDP) problem (Vandenberghe & Boyd, 1998) , which is a special case of convex optimization, and thus can be solved efficiently by, e.g., interior point methods (Helmberg et al., 1970) in polynomial time. Here we summarize our method. For a given neural network, we use MSA to train the model, i.e., iteratively computing the states (forward propagation) and co-states (backward propagation), and solving the optimization for each layer. Instead of directly maximizing the Hamiltonian, we add a positive semi-definite constraint to the optimization problem, which leads to a stable control of the dynamics. To evaluate the effectiveness of our method, we conduct experiments on CIFAR10. We trained the network on clean data, with adversarial training (PGD-10) and with robust training (our method), respectively. We used FGSM (Goodfellow et al., 2015) , PGD-10 (Madry et al., 2017) and C&W (Carlini & Wagner, 2017a) to attack the network. Due to the limitation of TensorFlow, we used a simple interior point method with gradient descent to solve SDP. The network model was an 18-layer residual network (He et al., 2015) , with 8 residual blocks. We set the perturbation size as = 0.1 for both FGSM and PGD. For C&W, we used the L 0 metric. We trained the model for 150 epochs with a batch size of 200. The learning rate was set to be 10 \\u22122 initially, and was divided by 5 at epoch 30, 60 and 100. The regularizer term constant was set to be 10 \\u22123 . The results can be seen in Table 1 . The accuracy of robust models on clean data is lower than vanilla model's in that robust training and generalization is more difficult and requires more data (Schmidt et al., 2018) . Our method improves model's adversarial robustness, compared with the vanilla model. Figure 1 displays the eigenvalues of the last fully-connected layer's parameter. The complex norm of eigenvalues (spectral radius) of the model trained by our method are effectively bounded below 1, which satisfies the robust constraint on parameters in section 4.2, while eigenvalues of natural training are randomly distributed in the complex plane. Our method is not as effective as traditional adversarial training method. However, it mainly has the following advantages: (a) The training process doesn't require large numbers of gradient propagation, which consumes much time in adversarial training. In our experiment, adversarial training spends about 10 times GPU time as much as our method. (b) The decoupled training process allows us to set different hyperparameters and training methods for different layers, which is more maneuverable for large scale training. We can further control the behavior of different layers in adversarial settings. (c) Lyapunov stability provides a framework for analyzing adversarial robustness of deep models, which may lead to theoretical analysis of adversarial samples in future work. Motivated by the dynamical system view of neural networks, this work bridges adversarial robustness of deep neural models with Lyapunov stability of dynamical systems, and we also propose a method that uses a stable optimal control algorithm to train neural networks to improve the adversarial robustness of deep neural models. Though the result didn't surpass STOA defense methods, the stable control view of training neural nets points out another direction towards adversarially robust models. For future work, on the one hand, mathematical analysis on Lyapunov stability of neural models may be studied to provide theoretical understanding of adversarial robustness. On the other hand, popular platforms for deep learning, e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch, didn't provide frameworks for optimal control. We will obtain better results if specific algorithms for SDP are applied to solve the optimization problem.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"paper_id\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 203,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"SyxvSiCcFQ\",\n          \"BJxRrlBFwB\",\n          \"BklVA2NYvH\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"target\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 203,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"We show that NN parameter and hyperparameter cost landscapes can be generated as quantum states using a single quantum circuit and that these can be used for training and meta-training.

Previous work has demonstrated and experimentally implemented the use of quantum hardware to perform binary classification, BID15 ) but this is not the same as the method proposed in this paper, as this work is based on a different, more general gate-based form of quantum computation as opposed to the quantum annealing devices of the former. The biggest such device in existence today contains just 72 highly imperfect qubits, but it is worth noting that progress has advanced at a particularly rapid pace over the past few years and a number are available for public access on the cloud. Just as in classical computing, small sets of quantum gates are universal in that they can be combined to generate any other. Step 2: We then build a quantum circuit analogue of the neural network U QN N that takes in a given set of weights (encoded within qubits as above) and an empty register, and outputs onto the register the corresponding accuracy according to the chosen neural network i.e U QN N (w, 0) = (w, acc w ).Step 3: Since U QN N is a quantum circuit, inputting weights in superposition form allows them to be processed in parallel. This is a single quantum state representing the entire landscape of the neural network by correlating every possible set of weights with its resultant accuracy. If we restrict the problem to the special case of binary arguments only, the sign function 1 is reduced to finding whether there exist N/2 qubits out of N in state |1 . The reversibility of quantum circuits allows us to apply the QBNN for a given data point, store its output value onto its corresponding qubit on the register, perform the same QBNN in reverse order -its inverse -to refresh the other qubits, and continue for the next data point in the training set. Since both the labels and the outputs are binary, we can represent the accuracy of each of these predictions by performing a NOT gate on all the qubits corresponding to a data point with a label of 0. If the prediction qubits are all in the state |1 the training was a success and the appropriate weights can be simply read off their corresponding qubits. In practice, due to qubit number constraints, we choose to only learn the structure of the first layer of the BNN. It is particularly interesting to note that the learned structures of the two BNN solutions seem to match well with their problem definitions (equation 1 and equation 2). In fact, such an implementation is advantageous since it would allow us to use less qubits which in practical terms are limited in number in the near term. Both of these problems arise completely from our implementation of the sign function, which could either be improved or replaced entirely with a different binary activation function that could be implemented more efficiently on a quantum computer and would be compatible with non-binary input. Whilst we used the example of quantum training, the most fruitful approach in the short term is to ask whether some property of the state can be used to glean useful information for classical machine learning methods. Further work in investigating the relationship between the landscape as a quantum state and its features from a machine learning perspective would be a step forward in this direction.\",\n          \"In the literature on artificial dialogue agents, a distinction is often made between \\\"goal-oriented\\\" dialogue, where an agent is tasked with filling slots or otherwise obtaining or disseminating specified information from the user to help complete a task, and \\\"chit-chat\\\", where an agent should imitate human small talk. We compare agents that have been trained to imitate human actions given a goal (an \\\"inverse model\\\") to two different RL approaches: optimizing actions with latent discrete variables (topics), or via rewarding actions sampled from the model (via the top-K outputs). Characters (either played by humans or run by models) can speak to to each other via free text, send emote actions like applaud, nod or pout (22 emote types in total), and take actions to move to different locations and interact with objects (e.g. get cutlery, put cutlery in drawer, etc.), see Appendix A for a full list of game actions. To make the world and its textual descriptions, LIGHT consists of a large set of human-written game locations, characters, and objects, all based within a fantasy medieval setting. While players were not given specific goals, but instead asked to play the role convincingly of the character given, during play some of them effectively defined their own goals during the interactions, see Fig. 1 . Similar to Mazar\\u00e9 et al. (2018) , during training we consider the other elements of the batch as negatives. We consider an inverse model, trained to imitate human actions given a goal, as both a baseline for comparing to RL models, and for producing weights form which we can fine-tune. Optimizing all the parameters of a large transformer architecture by RL is both incredibly costly in data efficiency and computing time, and is also known to have the problem of language drift (Lee et al., 2019) -that is, there is no guarantee after training with self-chat that the models will output recognizable natural language utterances. We then run K-means over the vectorial representations of all observations from the training set to provide the mapping to one of C values, which represent dialogue topics, which we use as our initial function P (s). The cluster chooser P is redefined (from the initial K-means) to be an MLP network consisting of 2 layers. We use the attention above weights of v context against the candidates at the last layer of the transformer as the distribution over the candidates for sampling an utterance. In Urbanek et al. (2019) models were trained in a similar fashion to chit-chat task models, and we adopt similar architectures here, but instead adapt them to learn to pursue goals. Earlier work focused on labeled state representations, slot filling mechanisms and dialogue managers (Rieser & Lemon, 2011) , and more recent work has shifted to an end-to-end approach (Bordes et al., 2017) , in line with chit-chat models, but still the two sets of tasks are rarely considered together, or by using the same methods. Other notable uses of RL in dialogue include within visual question answering (Das et al., 2017) , in the domain of chit-chat where RL has been used to decrease repetitive and generic responses through the the use of self-play (Li et al., 2016b) , and through human-bot conversation (Sankar & Ravi, 2019) . However, those approaches use RL to optimize the set of actions given feedback in a single-player rather than multi-player game, so the text only refers to the environment, and there is no dialogue or actions from other agents. We achieve this by defining a task for an agent, where the goal is for the other player to execute a particular action.\",\n          \"This decoupled training method allows us to add constraints to the optimization, which makes the deep model more robust. In this paper, we propose a dynamical system view on the adversarial robustness of the models, as well as new method that significantly defense adversarial attacks. On the one hand, deep residual networks (He et al., 2015) can be illustrated as forward Euler scheme approximating an ODE (E, 2017), which motivates us to design effective network structures (Lu et al., 2017) . On the other hand, regarding the network as a dynamical system allows us to set up an optimal control viewpoint of neural nets. If we regard a neural net as a dynamical system, and ensure the network is Lyapunov stable, then the model is robust to all (adversarial) perturbations. , where \\u03c3 is the activation function, e.g., Sigmoid function or ReLU function, it is stable if Re(\\u03bb i (A)) \\u2264 0, \\u2200i, where Re denotes the real part, and \\u03bb i denotes the i-th eigenvalue. In the field of deep learning, previous work has utilized MSA to train neural networks Li & Hao, 2018) . Concretely, after computing the states x and co-states p, the optimization step on layer t is only searching for parameters \\u03b8 t . Consider a layer in the form of f t (x) = \\u03b8 t x, where we leave the activation as an individual layer with no parameters for simplicity, we can derive the following optimization problem for Hamiltonian maximization: max It makes the optimization quite difficult if we directly add the constraints in gradient descent based algorithms, but the decoupled optimization in MSA allows us to do so. This can be reduced to a semi-definite programming (SDP) problem (Vandenberghe & Boyd, 1998) , which is a special case of convex optimization, and thus can be solved efficiently by, e.g., interior point methods (Helmberg et al., 1970) in polynomial time. For a given neural network, we use MSA to train the model, i.e., iteratively computing the states (forward propagation) and co-states (backward propagation), and solving the optimization for each layer. Due to the limitation of TensorFlow, we used a simple interior point method with gradient descent to solve SDP. The complex norm of eigenvalues (spectral radius) of the model trained by our method are effectively bounded below 1, which satisfies the robust constraint on parameters in section 4.2, while eigenvalues of natural training are randomly distributed in the complex plane. Motivated by the dynamical system view of neural networks, this study bridges adversarial robustness of deep neural models with Lyapunov stability of dynamical systems, and we also propose a method that uses a stable optimal control algorithm to train neural networks to improve the adversarial robustness of deep neural models. Though the result didn't surpass STOA defense methods, the stable control view of training neural nets points out another direction towards adversarially robust models.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"number_words_source\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 1898,\n        \"min\": 131,\n        \"max\": 13830,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 200,\n        \"samples\": [\n          7663,\n          5353,\n          3957\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"number_words_extractive\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 138,\n        \"min\": 131,\n        \"max\": 1069,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 167,\n        \"samples\": [\n          776,\n          609,\n          558\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

This paper addresses RL in the continuous action space, using a re-parametrised policy and a novel vector-based training objective. This work proposes to mix distributional RL with a net in charge of modeling the evolution of the world in terms of quantiles, claiming improvements in sample efficiency.\n",
