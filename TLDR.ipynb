              "'In particular, (Santurkar et al., 2018) recently studied the mode collapsing problem and further classified this into the missing mode problem i.e., the generated samples miss some modes in the true data, and the boundary distortion problem i.e., the generated samples can only partly recover some modes in the true data. To handle sequential data in the context of domain adaptation of software vulnerability detection, the work of proposed an architecture referred to as the Code Domain Adaptation Network (CDAN). A fully connected layer is then employed to connect the output layer of the Bidirectional RNN with the joint feature layer while bridging the gap between the source and target domains. In particular, (Santurkar et al., 2018) has recently studied the mode collapsing problem of GANs and discovered that they are also subject to i) the missing mode problem (i.e., in the joint space, either the target data misses some modes in the source data or vice versa) and ii) the boundary distortion problem (i.e., in the joint space either the target data partly covers the source data or vice versa), which makes the target distribution significantly diverge from the source distribution. To address the two inherent problems in the DDAN mentioned in Section 2.4, we employ two different generators G S and G T to map source and target domain examples to the joint space and two discriminators D S and D T to distinguish source examples against target examples and vice versa together with the source classifier C which is used to classify the source examples with labels as shown in Figure 2 . Updating the generators The two generators G S and G T are trained to i) maintain the manifold/cluster structures of source and target data in their original spaces to avoid the data distortion problem and ii) move the target samples toward the source samples in the joint space and resolve the missing mode and boundary distortion problems in the joint space. To move the target samples toward the source samples and resolve the missing mode and boundary distortion problems in the joint space, we propose minimizing the following objective function: Moreover, the source generator G S has to work out the representation that is suitable for the source classifier, hence we need to minimize the following objective function: GD-DDAN) . Therefore, Dual-GD-DDAN allows us to reduce the impact of the missing mode and boundary distortion problems, hence making the target distribution more identical to the source distribution in the joint space. Quantitative Results We first investigate the performance of our proposed Dual-GD-DDAN compared with other methods including VulDeePecker (VULD) without domain adaptation (Li et al., 2016) , DDAN , MMD , D2GAN (Nguyen et al., 2017) and DIRT-T with VAP applied in the joint feature layer using the architecture CDAN introduced in . Inspired by this observation, we compare our Dual-GD-DDAN with DDAN using the representations of the source and target samples in the joint feature space corresponding to their best models. In particular, for a given pair of source and target data sets and for comparing each method, we train a neural network classifier on the best representations of the source data set in the joint space, then predict on the source and target data set and do the same but swap the role of the source and target data sets. We can therefore conclude that our Dual-GD-DDAN method produces a better representation for source and target samples in the joint space and is less susceptible to boundary distortion compared with the DDAN method. These results further demonstrate the ability of our Dual-GD-SDDAN for dealing with the mode collapsing problem better than SCDAN , hence obtaining better predictive performance in the context of software domain adaptation. In this paper, we propose the Dual Generator-Discriminator Deep Code Domain Adaptation Network (Dual-GD-DDAN) method to deal with the missing mode and boundary distortion problems which arise from the use of the GAN principle when reducing the discrepancy between source and target data in the joint space. To deal with this problem, the study introduced in (Li et al., 2018) combined the learning of the vector representations and the training of a classifier in a deep neural network.'"
